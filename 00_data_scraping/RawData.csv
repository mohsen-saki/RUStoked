You don't have to be good mates to work, but it sure as hell makes things a whole lot easier. The second thing I like is there something for everyone if you don't feel comfortable in your current department you can change to another that best suits the type of person you are.Communication does break down -- that inevitable anywhere you go.

Being with the SDA union was also a great positive. There were many benifets included that helped me work for as long as I did.First of all: the Woolworths Radio.

I started in Woolworths young and didn't know how career development in the store worked so I missed out on learning some things in the earlier stages of my employment.

Staff are only rewarded based off if they are considered a 'favourite' rather than merit or work ethic. Bosses must have things their way regardless if things are already running smoothly.

After working with the company for so many years there was always new things to learn and opportunities to further my skills and development.

From working in night fill the greatest challenge is working fast and efficiently to get the load done in your designated shift. Although I have great time management skills, it can be quite a work out at times!",4.0,4 years ago,"2020, January"
Coles,"Good morale amongst workers and supervisors alike. Variety of areas - you get out and about, often seeing places you haven't been before. Because you're ducking in and around suburbs, you're not always fighting the mainstream traffic.  Finally, customers really appreciate the service, so you usually get a warm reception, and even get to know regulars. Can be a but hectic sorting and loading. Also out in the field the crates are often quite heavy, and need to be carried into people's homes, so the job's a genuine fitness developer.",4.0,2 years ago,"2020, January"

Higher career development within Coles is difficult or not even worth the effort, especially with the amount of stress you see department managers under.

There are plenty of opportunities to branch out into different departments and one department doesn't consist of just one task but rather, there are multiple jobs to do which makes every shift interesting and enjoyable. When the store gets extremely busy, working non-stop four hours without any break can be a little exhausting and quite painful with all the constant heavy-lifting. There are room for improvement within Coles in general with all the team members working as a team and in terms of the amount of work each worker is assigned.

You also get amazing incentives such as discount cards and further discounts via 'My Coles' online. My store is quite a small and outdated store, we struggle to keep up with new products coming in as we don't have enough equipment to use nor enough money in the budget to buy new equipment.

Coles,"The other employees were lovely and most of the time the customers were also friendly. It was nice to have worked in the same store for so long, purely because of the ability to get to know the staff and regular customers. Most of the time, while working as a customer service supervisor, we were understaffed. Team members from other departments were supposed to help out during busy periods, but rarely did, which left customers complaining about ques and service quality as there was a rush to get customers out of the store. Service staff got tired of being stuck on register and often complained or regularly called in sick and cancelled shifts at the last minute, making these shifts very difficult to replace. A number of jobs were required of service staff in addition to customer service (for example cleaning, putting stock away, filling drink fridges and confectionery stands) and due to lack of staff these jobs were often left not done. Store managers and other higher up staff would then complain to me and my direct customer service manager, without recognizing that the reason tasks were not completed was due to lack of staff, not incompetence. Customers, particularly cigarette customers and refund customers tended to be difficult. Cigarette customers were often rude and demanding, as were refund customers. Some refund customers claimed to know our refund policy more than myself, who had been working there for over 7 years, and demanded free products, when this was not allowed.",1.0,4 years ago,"2020, January"

Building great friendship bonds in a large team environment whilst providing great customer service no matter if it's the cleaner, filling the shelves or personal encounters. As a manager on salary it's demanding on personal life with no reward for overtime. Finding team members that want to be up skilled but not having the time or training budget to cater the needs.

Coles,The flexibility of hours and conditions. The diversity of types of duties and responsibilities. The wide range of people and the satisfaction of helping customers with their diverse needs successfully. There was also the opportunities to learn new skills which I put into good use in other jobs where I have worked subsequently. The challenges were to not only learn new skills but to apply those skills in problem solving whether it was to help a customer with their needs or to help the business present and market itself better. Another challenge was to find ways to conduct day to day operations more efficiently.,4.0,4 years ago,"2020, January"
Coles,"Their were so many good things the people you work with just like you they are just every day Australians everyone is so nice, I got to experience every department which was good one day I'd serve people the next day I'd be cutting and wrapping up fruit or grabbing trolleys for the store their was never a dull moment at coles. You don't always get a long with everyone but I think that happens in every work place I wouldn't say their were many challenges at coles I was very looked after by the staff I had a great supportive team, I did the work the most difficult part if any was the customers as they can be very demanding sometimes,",5.0,4 years ago,"2020, January"
Coles,"I worked for Grocery Night Fill. 
Good thing is your always busy, always moving so time really goes by fast. 
Work hours was good, mostly at nighttime with latest 12am which fits in well for people doing full time 9-5 jobs or have uni. The rate of fill for Coles the company is highly unrealistic, especially for splitting the load. As a company, their workload expectation is too much with not enough hours, but individual stores just place work hours as needed so it doesn't matter too much.",4.0,4 years ago,"2020, January"
Coles,"Shift hours are extremely flexible for casual employees, so there is a good work/life balance. The store staff are becoming increasingly diverse, which is a good sign for the company. Management is dysfunctional. The wages are moderate to low.

Coles,Working indoors is good. The work is expected to be fast paced and efficient. There are regular celebratory lunches put on for team members. The tea room always has free food of some kind. Interacting with customers is more better than it is worse. Your work is expected to be completed whether there is enough time or not. There is culture of people doing work for free and working through breaks to get all tasks completed. People that don't are somewhat frowned upon un-officially.,3.0,3 years ago,"2020, January"
Coles,"Fast paced working environment makes for quick shifts. Friendly team members also make for quick shifts and good relationships.

Coles,"Met some really great people here and my direct mangers were always lovely. Though incredibly time-poor, they were always friendly and did their best to support you when possible. You do learn a lot about the Retail/FMCG industry and related fields (Product Development, Marketing etc) so if you're willing to put in long hours and ask lots of questions, you will gain a lot of knowledge and valuable industry experience. The pay was also excellent, though you have to weigh up if it's really worth it based on the lack of work-life balance. If you are a very competitive, profit-driven person and your career is your priority, then it might suit you - it just wasn't the right fit for me at all. There were certainly a few individuals who were working hard to improve the culture, but when I left there was still a LONG way to go. I was relieved to walk out those doors for the last time. Huge workload, and little training beforehand. The Graduate program induction focuses a lot on the business' achievements and values but there was very little on-the-job training specific to your actual role. It is incredibly competitive, and Grads are handed huge projects without any proper support, as the managers are often too busy in meetings or with other 'higher priorities' to properly train you. It's very much a 'sink or swim' culture at the 'Store Support Center' (Head Office) which can be incredibly draining. A lot of decisions are made for personal/department benefit or to cut costs and hit targets in the short term, when these decisions make very little sense for the operations of Stores. Having worked both in-store and at Head Office I have seen the frustrations from both sides. Essentially, it comes down to poor senior management and short-term thinking that hasn't benefited the business overall. This creates a further divide between stores and head office (very 'us vs them') and in the end everybody loses.",2.0,1 year ago,"2020, January"

Coles,"Regular customers are fun and I kept some of my best friends from there. The team was very inclusive and felt like an actual team.  Orders came from head office, ignoring feedback from local managers. Managers changed so frequently it was rare that anyone knew their team and their strengths/weaknesses; your record was wiped clear every 6 months and any plans for promotion went with them.
Customers would have no problems being rude or causing a scene over anything. Managers would blame you if they had to be involved, head office ignored this problem. Some weaker managers would even dress you down to satisfy the customer and keep their hands clean. ",3.0,6 months ago,"2020, January"

On people's anniversary so of working, SOME stores hold little morning teas, free lunch is always a plus. You receive no appreciation for the work you put in. Management looks down on you and tends to keep to their own little cliques. Think of it as being back in highschool, where everyone is broken off into their own cliques and the school principal has it in for all the teachers, so the teachers just stop caring about the students. The students in turn hate it so much that they either stay there being miserable in hopes of progressing or would rather leave and do nothing with their lives.

With very minimal training or advice you are expected to achieve results and targets that are not even explained to you.

Coles,The regular customers A manager with bi-polar,3.0,4 years ago,"2020, January"
Coles,"My regular customers. When on the registers I often have a line up of people waiting to be served by myself rather than others. Makes you feel appreciated. Sunday rates are really good as well. They provide fruit most days of the week in the staff room, and occasionally baked goods too. These are often over ripe, blemished or burnt though. Being many different personalities, you often find people you get a long well with. Managers often weren't interested in following own company guidelines or OHS. They would pressure you to work additional hours, not taking no for an answer, calling every day off to ask if you could come in for shifts. Stock takes were often held anywhere from 11 pm til 6 am. Not enough staff hour allocation, so you were often the only one on register or shop floor, which makes for very unhappy customers. Customers hound you on arrival and up until you get in your car, as there is no one else available. Too many bosses with different ideas of how things should be done, demanding you do one task three different ways. Then when you need the bosses, you often can't get in contact with them. Shift managers that aren't properly trained are a definite problem. We got a pay cut too. Changing your permanent roster is a real hassle, management often try to con you into signing paperwork without you being able to read it. Store managers all seem to lack any basic communication skills or manners, unless talking to customers or higher ups. You get new store managers almost every year so everything changes a lot.",1.0,1 year ago,"2020, January"

Yearly appraisals are done with goal setting. I saw many changes when I was there and it is great management are focused on adopting new technologies and changing outdated procedures. Great work life balance. Team work is highly encouraged. On-site parking. Friendly colleagues and senior management. Aldi is well respected and looks great on the resume - you will have no trouble finding work if you have Aldi experience. Aldi is definitely a workplace for high performers who are looking to continually improve and those types of people will excel in their roles - not the place for plodders or those that lack discipline.

Depending on closing times, you still have plenty of time after work to go out for dinner or do a bit of socialising, particularly in summer.

Safety is paramount and definately a well structured company. Store Manager is very hands on and always supportive giving constructive criticism which helps make the learning process easy.

Challenges within the job was management (upper and lower). The Aldi culture seems to be one not based on merit but who knows who. It needs a massive culture change. Also, training is dismissed as upper management don't particularly want to train people as it gets in the way of store productivity rating. Also,ALDI tends to work on a small number of productive staff they do not believe in full time work instead they use smaller teams of staff usually on part time hours to get jobs done quicker to rely on productivity bonus, everything in ALDI is timed to the minute.

ALDI are one of the few companies who control the loss and gain by making the staff mark off palets as they arrive for delivery they will often deliberatley take things off the order or ask managers to hide things in an attempt to catch staff out this to me is very childish and unprofessional of a company that on paper is doing so well. The training at ALDI is almost non existent you are thrown in at the deep end almost from day one and alot of management and current staff use new starters to do all the horrible tasks that they do not want to complete. The registers (which everyone must learn) they are set for you to work incredibly fast but in order to do so you must remember at least over 100 PLU numbers on the tills - again management will often send in area managers in plain clothes with test trollies in a bid to keep staff in check.

KPI's are set in December after which plans for the year are made which impacts stores abilities to meet them. Managers are then held accountable despite the decision being made above their heads. 
Accountability is rolled downhill. 
Days off are virtually non-existant to many managers, there is little assistance to cover managers who are sick or have left. Which means store managers can often be working extremely long days or full weeks due to no one else being available. 
As the roles in stores are so hard to fill it is also very difficult to move from store manager to area manager, or other corporate roles.

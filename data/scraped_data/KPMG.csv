While they love forming those teams on large high-profile work, \""smaller jobs\"" (sub 250k) seldom see other specialists involved. 

Wages are lower than competition (literally every offer I've had since joining has exceeded my wage by at least 20%), and an emphasis on reducing overheads means investment cases are mostly all talk. They also place too much value on loyalty, meaning wage negotiations often go off the rails leaving a good deal of the talent open to poaching by other firms that actually do invest. I recommend you get to know the team really well before committing, and never accept a promise of future investment on the words of senior partners alone - they're so seldom the decision makers anyway.

It's a fast paced environment so you'll never get bored. 

My team was very supportive and were flexible with my work arrangements well beyond any other company I've ever worked for. *This may not be the same across every team* 

SEEK is inclusive and genuinely wants to match the right candidate to the right job. Educating employers on the issues surrounding ""unconcious bias"" and putting tools in place to help minimise it was particularly rewarding to be a part of. You see many POC, people with diabilities and different age ranges working at Seek. ","Budgets became near impossible to achieve in the last few years of working there- this was felt across all sales teams. It meant I had to take my work home with me a lot and it was difficult to navigate the cause of the issue with management. 

It's so fast paced that sometimes products/services are released before everyone - including managers- are fully across them which can be frustrating as it happens often and can be very confusing. 

Management is thinley stretched so you need to be quite autonomous. 
This was fine for me but many scenarios that would've been less of a strain if management had time to manage. 

If you want career development, know that this is easier to achieve in the Melbourne office (HQ), in other regional offices this will be a challenge. 

If you're outside of HQ, the training falls on the team which can mean that your work suffers until the new person can fly over for a formal induction which can take months. Hopefully this will be fixed.

Though incredibly time-poor, they were always friendly and did their best to support you when possible. You do learn a lot about the Retail/FMCG industry and related fields (Product Development, Marketing etc) so if you're willing to put in long hours and ask lots of questions, you will gain a lot of knowledge and valuable industry experience. The pay was also excellent, though you have to weigh up if it's really worth it based on the lack of work-life balance. If you are a very competitive, profit-driven person and your career is your priority, then it might suit you - it just wasn't the right fit for me at all. There were certainly a few individuals who were working hard to improve the culture, but when I left there was still a LONG way to go. I was relieved to walk out those doors for the last time.","Huge workload, and little training beforehand. The Graduate program induction focuses a lot on the business' achievements and values but there was very little on-the-job training specific to your actual role. It is incredibly competitive, and Grads are handed huge projects without any proper support, as the managers are often too busy in meetings or with other 'higher priorities' to properly train you. It's very much a 'sink or swim' culture at the 'Store Support Center' (Head Office) which can be incredibly draining. A lot of decisions are made for personal/department benefit or to cut costs and hit targets in the short term, when these decisions make very little sense for the operations of Stores. Having worked both in-store and at Head Office I have seen the frustrations from both sides. Essentially, it comes down to poor senior management and short-term thinking that hasn't benefited the business overall.

It was nice to have worked in the same store for so long, purely because of the ability to get to know the staff and regular customers.","Most of the time, while working as a customer service supervisor, we were understaffed. Team members from other departments were supposed to help out during busy periods, but rarely did, which left customers complaining about ques and service quality as there was a rush to get customers out of the store. Service staff got tired of being stuck on register and often complained or regularly called in sick and cancelled shifts at the last minute, making these shifts very difficult to replace. A number of jobs were required of service staff in addition to customer service (for example cleaning, putting stock away, filling drink fridges and confectionery stands) and due to lack of staff these jobs were often left not done. Store managers and other higher up staff would then complain to me and my direct customer service manager, without recognizing that the reason tasks were not completed was due to lack of staff, not incompetence. Customers, particularly cigarette customers and refund customers tended to be difficult. Cigarette customers were often rude and demanding, as were refund customers. Some refund customers claimed to know our refund policy more than myself, who had been working there for over 7 years, and demanded free products, when this was not allowed.",Recommends working here: No,Rates salary as: Low,4 years ago,,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Coles Supermarkets

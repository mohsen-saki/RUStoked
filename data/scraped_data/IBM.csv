The company promotes work life balance on a regular basis but the reality is they expect you to work 50 to 60 hours a week and expect you to be available at all times.  If you resist these work pressures you are ostracised very quickly.  

In Melbourne there have been 5 years of man redundancy rounds and the numbers of staff in IBM Melbourne today is a fraction of what worked for the company 5 years ago.  The company use to occupy most of a 29 story building and now the company only occupies 5 floors and have sold the building to a Chinese company.

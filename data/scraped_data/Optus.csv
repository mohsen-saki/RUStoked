- you get a discounted phone plan for yourself and additional services.
- it is flexible to an extent- my manager has always been good in approving leave within limits (exam period for uni etc). ","- As it is retail, expect to work every single saturday/sunday (being a part-timer). In this sense it isn't very flexible with social life. 
- Micromanagement by some managers.
- Constant changes in technology and plans/promotions (can be hard to keep up when you're juggling university).
- No work events besides the annual Christmas party that retail staff don't usually attend.
- The CUSTOMERS are probably the most challenging part of the job. If you do not enjoy irate, uncontrollable customers and confrontation, this job is not for you. 
- No real training- when you begin you do modules and you are thrown into the deep end to serve customers. In busy periods it is hard to get the aid of a senior assistant as they may be with their own customers.
- System errors- the new systems are always crashing- leaving the customer sometimes angry and impatient.

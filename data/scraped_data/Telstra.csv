I found that working in company with groups of individuals who had the commitment to provide the best that they could to a very high standard to be both educative and inspirational. The people I worked with were open and willing to giving advice and assistance without hesitation or prejudice. While it was impossible to avoid personality conflicts all of the time, mutual respect for the individual was evident due to the knowledge, skills, capabilities, and experience that each of my colleagues possessed. I enjoyed the challenges related to the problem-solving aspects of my day-to-day work as they continued to help me learn and develop my knowledge and skills. I gained satisfaction in the belief that I was trying to make a worthwhile contribution to the country and that I was involved in an industry that contributed to the nations' prosperity.","As a member of the field workforce in various roles over 35 years service, the greatest challenges revolved around giving service to the country in an industry that, by and large, was vital to the economic and social development of the community as a whole. As an individual working in a rapidly evolving technological field, the challenges related to maintaining currency with the latest technologies and systems were constant and unrelenting. These difficulties were met with resolve and persistence in order to gain the required mastery and proficiency necessary to continue working in the field. In addition to our daily activities, each of us in the field were obligated to maintain 24 hour availability when not on duty. The added stress of being required to respond to reports where there was a risk to public safety meant that we were never able to get sufficient rest in order to meet the next days challenges.
The greatest challenges originated from within those parts of the organisation not directly associated with the customer-facing sections of the organisation. In addition to the inertia and restrictions placed on the field workforce by the management and administrative parts of the organisation, vested, sectional, and political interests affected the overall perceptions of how each individual in the field was regarded and treated  by the community. These perceptions tended largely to be extremely negative, and coloured the opinions and reactions of the vast majority of the population. 
In that period between 1990 and 2007, I was working in a part of the organisation that was highly visible and therefore extremely vulnerable to the negative and anti-social attitudes and behaviours that were exhibited by a large proportion of the general populace throughout that period of time. Virtually all of the publicity generated from outside of the organisation was negative, derogatory and disparaging of the organisation, and each incident further inflamed the situations I found myself in each and every day.
The organisations' management were disinclined to offer any  explanation to counter any and all claims from any source against us , and this situation imbued most of us in the field with the belief that the work we were doing was not worthwhile or appreciated by any one person in the community.",Recommends working here: No,Rates salary as: Average,4 years ago,"Greater Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,Telstra

Senior management is unapproachable and permanently locked in meetings which should be delegated meaning engagement and feedback are often lost. A lot of interaction are driven by rank, as expected in a very hierarchical organization, but this means a lot of time and energy is wasted showing face. Performance and review cycles are annual and leave little room for market growth nor negotiations: you are better off leaving and returning for a higher rate than attempting to negotiate.

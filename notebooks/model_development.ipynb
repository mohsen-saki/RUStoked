The pay is good but ALDI makes sure you work your bones for this pay. Even working as an Area Manager, you will still have to work during weekends, therefore there is no family work balance.

Without any formal training I was asked to deal with a portfolio of clients within two weeks into my role, setting me up for failure. The portfolio was also vacant for 8 months before I was appointed so customers weren't happy and my work phone wouldn't stop ringing including weekends. Overall poor experience, wouldn't recommend NAB to my enemy. Also if you have an appetite for commercial lending don't get misled by NAB small business, their bankers courtesy handful of introducers just do home lending to business customers and achieve revenue targets.

Very frequent changes very often, lots of workload, not easy to upgrade to latest technology due to the cost of huge systems upgrade\",\"\\u2018Yes for a stable job, but no room for development\\u2019 Average pay, good customer base It's not a fair roster to work with, management won't do much about it even they know the problems\",\"\\u2018A place that is not worth your time, very terribly run with bad procedures.\\u2019 Does 5% discount and free cookies count as a good thing? Terrible management, bad operational structures, overall a terrible work place where very few people actually pull their weight and 'work'\",\"\\u2018Fun and professional\\u2019 Kitchen teas and employee events Enjoyed investigative challenges\",\"\\u2018Overall good with a real capability to make a difference in the environment.\\u2019 Teamwork and challenging projects and programs with talented people and partner vendors. Dynamism with a parent company juggling Optus with other SingTel companies. Strong emphasis of processes and procedures related to all facets especially the finances abd reporting as well as the funding project gates.\",\"\\u2018Great place and opportunity to start but difficult to climb the corporate ranks.\\u2019 Good place to start working for new graduates/migrants seeking to gain experience in the Financial Services industry with focus on equity markets and instruments. The company structure and work scope makes it a little hard to get promotion and achieve higher work responsibilities.\",\"\\u2018Good Experience\\u2019 Good Company, exciting projects, decent workload....... Overcrowded - more people than desks..... \\nlots of young and opportunistic people with low ethics and high ambitions.\",\"\\u2018The management team from top to bottom need to start treating people like humans not expendable assets!!\\u2019 The hours worked with my lifestyle. Dealing with management was painful, and colleagues are constantly breaking the rules and it all gets overlooked \",\"\\u2018Being able to do things in a flexible way.\\u2019 Being able to work in calm environment. Having to complete all the required tasks in one day.\",\"\\u2018It is different than the other retail jobs and the different is in a good way and the customers are great. ALDI is overall a motivator for my life. Definetely you will be more active than ever before and you will love it.\\u2019 I meet various customers during my shifts and love serving them at the best and helping them out with their needs and make sure they repeat the business. It is a very challenging every minute to get the work done, no matter what time is your shift or what kind of job you assign to you have to speed up yourself to reach the goals. Out of all filling is pretty hard and once you got into the track you will enjoy it.\",\"\\u2018A very boring experience\\u2019 The work is easy, small learning curve  Unrealistic expectations from management\",\"\\u2018Geeat people lots of opportunities for career advancement.\\u2019 9 day fortnight , training New equipment\",\"\\u2018Redundancy.\\u2019 IBM is very open to flexible working arrangements, and with a young family I was able to work from home quite regularly. I even took my work \\\\\\\"on the road\\\\\\\" with me when my wife wanted to visit her family for an extended weekend. As the only local member of a team which was managed in Sydney and had team members in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Ballarat, I found it quite isolating. When I went into the local office at Ballarat I was surrounded by people I did not know or work with nor have any interactions with. My human interactions were limited to the occasional voice chat with a close working colleague and weekly catchups with my manager, neither of whom I ever met in person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe left Melbourne as a family and I took a significant pay cut to move to Ballarat to take up the opportunity with IBM. After being retrenched I was faced with moving back to Melbourne, commuting or retraining. We chose to keep our house and family in Ballarat, so in essence working with IBM destroyed my career.\",\"\\u2018I just love the type of work\\u2019 Travel Getting some big hard jobs done on time\",\"\\u2018Great organisation that adapt to clients demands and drive change\\u2019 Great balance between performance and people aspect Adapt and build your internal network\",\"\\u2018Not the worst but not the best.\\u2019 Subsidy to participate in health activities like 'around the bay' Immature Project Management structures. Poor quality of Project staff, especially Project managers. No new blood, most management are those been there for >20 years and still set in old ways.\",\"\\u2018I want a new job\\u2019 When you get to clock out Reasoning. And not with the customers but with fellow Co workers.\",\"\\u2018My time with Woolworths was extremely enjoyable with many opportunities for career development.\\u2019 Great opportunities for career

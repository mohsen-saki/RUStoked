There are rules in place to ensure that injury is unlikely. HR and the union tend to be quite proactive when required. I've made a lot of valuable friendships working here. Unsuitable and unapproachable individuals often get promoted to positions of authority while good quality workers get fed up and quit. Wage cuts are extreme. WH&S rules are often so strict that they gets in the way of efficiency. When sales targets are not met, the budget is cut in a vain effort to reclaim lost profits. Lower staff members are overworked.

You see many POC, people with diabilities and different age ranges working at Seek.

It meant I had to take my work home with me a lot and it was difficult to navigate the cause of the issue with management. \\n\\nIt's so fast paced that sometimes products/services are released before everyone - including managers- are fully across them which can be frustrating as it happens often and can be very confusing. \\n\\nManagement is thinley stretched so you need to be quite autonomous. \\nThis was fine for me but many scenarios that would've been less of a strain if management had time to manage. \\n\\nIf you want career development, know that this is easier to achieve in the Melbourne office (HQ), in other regional offices this will be a challenge. \\n\\nIf you're outside of HQ, the training falls on the team which can mean that your work suffers until the new person can fly over for a formal induction which can take months.

Overall poor experience, wouldn't recommend NAB to my enemy.

Weekend work (time & half or double on Sundays) frees up a week day or two for things like shopping. Targets and KPI's are set almost as a challenge. No commission if not 100% reached each month.  Some restrictions on what can be used in a conflict resolution.

I even took my work \\\\\\\"on the road\\\\\\\" with me when my wife wanted to visit her family for an extended weekend. As the only local member of a team which was managed in Sydney and had team members in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Ballarat, I found it quite isolating. When I went into the local office at Ballarat I was surrounded by people I did not know or work with nor have any interactions with. My human interactions were limited to the occasional voice chat with a close working colleague and weekly catchups with my manager, neither of whom I ever met in person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe left Melbourne as a family and I took a significant pay cut to move to Ballarat to take up the opportunity with IBM.

was the best job I had during University and worked well around life in general. The shifts weren't very long but I was grateful because the job is quite physical. Great place for people of many walks of life, stages of life and ages!\\u2019 -Casual work is very flexible for Uni students or parents\\n-People were great and easy going\\n-Nightfill is an easy job once you know how to do it\\n-Can be fun\\n-A lot of shifts -Management are constantly changing\\n-High staff turn over \\n-Never enough staff\",\"\\u2018Caring people with great working ethics.\\u2019 The store runs well because we have a good management team in place. There are a few bugs but generally management cares about its staff and makes sure to reward them for hard work. There are always things that need to be improved, and the team works really hard to do so. Things like chain of command can be a bit tricky to navigate if you are unfamiliar with the system.\",\"\\u2018Much better than working for Woolworths\\u2019 The Team Members.Management are great they always say hello & say goodbye when they leave. Everyone thanks everyone for coming in to work or if they've been called in... Customers in self serve don't listen or read..very impatient too much complaining in self serve..Needs to be at least 2 workers supervising self serve..\",\"\\u2018Great place to work , I have made so many fantastic people and some beautiful friends.\\u2019 Great job for a mum with little kids at home as you can do nightfill and be home with your children in the day .\\nYou make friends with the people your work with so it\\u2019s fun sometimes to work together. Late nights \\nSometimes you work 6 nights straight \\nNot many nights at home\",\"\\u2018Coles is a very poor employer when it comes to job security, management outcomes and training, and following it own guidelines when it comes to treating its employees with compassion.\\u2019 Coles is okay to work for if you only need casual work of between 12 and 20 hrs.  Anything above this is not forth coming.  Good work for juniors after school.   Management is very poor and employees are poorly treated.  There is little to none affirmative outcomes for good work and next to no opportunities to progress through the organization or increase your work hours.  Management constantly uses threats of 'loss of hours' if you constructively complain about internal work processes.  Coles needs to vastly improve its treatment of its workforce.\",\"\\u2018Once at Coles always at Coles\\u2019 There are different departments to work in and many shifts to work according to your availability . Coles Supermarkets are open from 6:00 am to 12:00 P.m. but overnight shifts are also there. Just bring your willingness  and energy  to work. Your skills May not be utilised completely\",\"\\u2018A good place to work but little care about the treatment of employees\\u2019 Good environment and team approach. Great benefits, exposure to different parts of the business and opportunity to develop A lot of duplicated work across teams, poor systems, terrible culture in some teams which has become worse since the downsize earlier this year.\",\"\\u2018Easy money where your work stays at work\\u2019 Awesome hours for me to work- a lot of different departments to be cross trained and allowing you to work at different times of the day to suit your lifestyle... Studying, mum, part time with another job. It all works so well, and it's easy! From working in night fill the greatest challenge is working fast and efficiently to get the load done in your designated shift. Although I have great time management skills, it can be quite a work out at times!\",\"\\u2018This job isant for every one being a nightfiller can annoy you  most of the time \\nI love it cos I like to sweat and get my adrenaline pumpimg but i don't like the gym for some reason I don't know why \\u2019 The people  that you work with can be amazing to work just the  managers will do your head in  Meeting the requirements of your department mangers alot of times they ask the  impossible \",\"\\u2018Great life learning job and experience\\u2019 Getting to interact with different people everyday, good first job for someone who's young and studying, great life learning skills and you also meet really friendly people Dealing with unhappy customers and working out a solution to them happy, taking on different Responsibilities.\",\"\\u2018Great place to work and Ive met some amazing people along the way.\\u2019 You work in a team environment to give your customers the best experience. Friendly work colleagues, brand new building. I honestly love my job as a checkout assistant because no day is the same  Sometimes you get the occasional customer that's having a hard day that lashes out at the one's on register and that in itself if challenging. To not take it personal. Apart from that I personally haven't found the job challenging.\",\"\\u2018Met some amazing people who I will cherish and have in my life forever, but when I leave, they're the only aspect of Coles that I'll miss.\\u2019 The positive side of work is that you get the opportunity to meet and work with some great people, and make new friends. If inclined, you can also progress up the Coles ladder with a bit of hard work and initiative. The hardest part about working at Coles is dealing with the levels of ineptitude on all levels of management. The micromanaging. The unrealistic expectations. You'd think the customers would be the worst part, but they aren't. Upper management need to spend more time on the floor with the working bees to understand the amount of work that goes on to keep the shop functioning.\",\"\\u2018Well looked after, a great company to work for.\\u2019 Working in family-based environment, we're like a family, everyone gets along, receiving  boxes of chocolate at christmas from the company. Coles looks after you. Understanding staff workplace health and mental health. Flexible hours, awards are given out for work, Coles recognising you, in regards into how long you have worked there for example; 5 or 10 years, you'll receive a luncheon, or if a team member is leaving you will receive a going away lunch as well. Coles is a very good company to work for. As well as having Wesfarmers as our parent company, there are offers to benefit Coles team members as well from Wesfarmers. Ive enjoyed working with the people who i work with, seeing people come and go. The late nights, really drains you after working a week of night shifts. Another challenge would be Christmas eve. Very busy indeed, but that day alway goes the fastest, fastest working day of the year. \\r\\nI'd love to have more new things in the workplace, more updated facilities. For example; new sinks or taps little things like that.\",\"\\u2018Worth working there - I would again.\\u2019 Pay was good. Break times were fair. Good amount of shifts. Understanding and caring team members and management. Great support. If not busy there wasn't much to do at times and the time passed very slowly. Mostly great customers but there were a few who were having a bad day and decided to take it out on the workers who were trying to be nothing but polite and friendly and do their job.\",\"\\u2018Great company with equal opportunities and a low but fair income\\u2019 Very well organised company and systems that make the job easy to follow and understand. Pay is weekly and overtime rates are reasonable. If part time employment is for you then Coles is a great organisation to work for. Pay isn't the best however it is regular. If career progression is important then I would not recommend Coles however it is possible to move up the ranks for some. Working hours aren't suited to everyone.\",\"\\u2018I have worked with the company  a long time . Things are far tougher  than they used to be and people are under too much pressure it is not enjoyable.\\u2019 If you have an engaged and encouraging manager working  for this company is great.\\nUnfortunately  there are few left as the pressure that is placed  on managers has seen all the good ones leave or step down. Getting good team members  that want a job and want to come to work.\\nToo many people  are more concerned about how too many hours will affect their centerlink payment  hence they  dont want too many hours. ... Ridiculous\",\"\\u2018I would recommend for a good first job, but know your working rights.\\u2019 When you have a team your close with and work well with. Work is fun and enjoyable going into. Makes it worth the effort. The issue with the company is management don't encourage enough for development within, they hire out. They also can be very belittling they don't help with issues quick enough and forget about some as if the issue is nothing.\",\"\\u2018A steady, challenging but worth job. Sometimes a little tiring, but rewarding at the end of the day.\\u2019 The working environment is friendly. The supervisors, managers and the workers take care of you well. There are plenty of opportunities to branch out into different departments and one department doesn't consist of just one task but rather, there are multiple jobs to do which makes every shift interesting and enjoyable. When the store gets extremely busy, working non-stop four hours without any break can be a little exhausting and quite painful with all the constant heavy-lifting. There are room for improvement within Coles in general with all the team members working as a team and in terms of the amount of work each worker is assigned. I feel as though the hours are not flexible and in terms of being able to get set a permanent time roster, it is not possible due to the large number of workers?\",\"\\u2018Amazing three years working part-time at Coles that definitely enriched my time as a uni student, developing experiences and friendships that will last a lifetime.\\u2019 Fun and positive working environment, flexibility, high salary and great people Some management issues on the higher levels, but generally didn't affect working life.\",\"\\u2018Great working environment.\\u2019 I loved working with a great team and my manager was very helpful with giving me hours that would work well with my other commitments. Lifting heavy packages and standing for a whole shift are the main physical challenges. Being able to know where all the products are to help customers find them is the biggest challenge, especially when you first start working in a store.\",\"\\u2018Has been a character building experience.\\u2019 You have a mostly strong supportive team and management around you that assist and guide you as you begin working at Coles. They also offer a strong level of support and assistance throughout your career at Coles as new challenges are met. It would depend upon which department you are involved in, but meting customer demands can be difficult at times. Sometimes you have to come up with solutions on the spot and meet compromises.\",\"\\u2018Good for the purpose of an in-between job while studying but not a forever job. \\u2019 It's great for someone who wants to work while pursuing something on the side (study/school, second job, hobbies). Once you get a contract it's quite stable work.  Higher career development within Coles is difficult or not even worth the effort, especially with the amount of stress you see department managers under. Store managers and upper management are all about the money, never concerned with you or other staff. As a result there can be an imbalance in the workload and long-term staff are often in resentment. \",\"\\u2018Good place to start your first job\\u2019 Great working enviroment always helpful you do short shifts wich is great when for a university student! Flexible with roster wich can be helpful. Late nights, starting late during day! Management not always apprciate work and hours you put in\",\"\\u2018It's amazing and you couldn't ask for any better job.\\u2019 Meeting new people every day and being able to work around school. I love working on the checkouts and doing trolleys as you can be inside and outside. People trust me to serve them with great pressure and able to understand what things are thrown on me. How busy it gets through the day and having to work while there is traffic and lots of pressure put on you. Having to push trolleys around when there is people everywhere and lots of cars in the car park. When I first started at Coles things where challenging, but now I have worked there for a year I know the in's and out's of how to serve people and how to push the trolleys and not hit anyone.\",\"\\u2018Good environment and good pay.\\u2019 Pay for casuals is fantastic, great penalty rates, ability to pick up shifts across different departments, staff portal is easy to use and can access documents with ease.

Due to high employee numbers, there can be problems with getting hours depending on your availability. Due to economic difficulties there is also a reduce in staff, so during busy periods it can be demanding.\",\"\\u2018Loved serving customers, hated dealing with poor management.\\u2019 Serving customers. Working with some very nice people. Most importantly I met my partner at Coles. Best thing about working there! Dealing with poor, impassionate management.\",\"\\u2018I have been able to develop and grow and make friends, and learn how to keep a straight face.\\u2019 My coworkers are mostly amazing, and the break room is top notch. The discount card has a wide variety of stores it works at. The uniform isn't awful, and they offer a lot of activities to do outside of work with coworkers. The management is constantly changing and it is difficult to know what the policy is at any stage. It gets very stressful and repetitive, and dealing with customers so much can be very tiring.\",\"\\u2018Mostly positive, have some what enjoyed my time there and would recomend for anybody looking for causal/part time employment or for a first job.\\u2019 Great CO workers, everybody is so lovely, always willing to help out. Nice meeting lots of new people too Dealing with difficult customers and having to deal with shoplifters occasionally\",\"\\u2018There are much worse places to work for people with or without qualifications\\u2019 Working indoors is good. The work is expected to be fast paced and efficient. There are regular celebratory lunches put on for team members. The tea room always has free food of some kind. Interacting with customers is more better than it is worse. Your work is expected to be completed whether there is enough time or not. There is culture of people doing work for free and working through breaks to get all tasks completed.

Trying to call in sick for a 5 am shift and not being able to due to not having a drs certificate. Trying to get annual leave as well could be a up hill battle as well. Physical repetitive nature of the role as well as the length of time spent there (3 yrs) with no real investment into the training and development of the staff nor any real progress/ interest by management shown. \",\"\\u2018It was a good life experience which I learnt many things.\\u2019 Meeting new people and having a challenge every shift. From working here, I now cannot walk into any shop without bringing all the stock to the front. (Also known as facing) From gathering these simple skills it has helped me improve my work ethic and I love making everything neat and tidy. Working with people that you don't want to work with.

I left Coles for a couple of years and came back due to further study commitments and it was so easy to get back in because of my previous experience. I love that I\\u2019ll always have some form of job opportunity in Coles. Challenging customers.

The team was very inclusive and felt like an actual team.  Orders came from head office, ignoring feedback from local managers. Managers changed so frequently it was rare that anyone knew their team and their strengths/weaknesses; your record was wiped clear every 6 months and any plans for promotion went with them.\\nCustomers would have no problems being rude or causing a scene over anything. Managers would blame you if they had to be involved, head office ignored this problem. Some weaker managers would even dress you down to satisfy the customer and keep their hands clean. \",\"\\u2018Great experience\\u2019 Working as a team , support and share habit.

It was a catch 22.\",\"\\u2018Overall a good job but they are over staffed and can't offer enough hours for it to a sustainable work environment.\\u2019 Coles Customer Care are great to deal with. With a priority line for all customer service agents, issues are dealt with promptly and with little fuss. No need to liaise with your manager when out doing deliveries. MDT's make navigation and timing drop off's with breaks easy. Good work-out doing deliveries. Don't need the gym. Trucks are well maintained and good to drive with all the latest safety techs. Getting the crates from the truck to the customers kitchen bench.

They have many stores around Australia allowing most to work 5-10 minutes from home. You make lifelong friends with other staff members and have some amazing customers.

You don't see eye to eye with everyone and it's challenging trying to have the same goal (customers coming first) when management don't put staff first.\",\"\\u2018Good company to work for\\u2019 Working for a large company which is very stable and employs many people ,you can work different shifts some times to suet you if casual or part time and you can choose the days you want to work  great for student .

Relatively stable hours for casuals and plenty of opportunities for part-time contracts. The expectation is that you will be available for any possible shift including split shifts. No opportunity to progress, incredibly difficult to change departments or be transferred to a different store.\",\"\\u2018Good if you want money but no work/life balance\\u2019 The people you work with at store level are great.  if you want to go higher in the business, the opportunities do exist, pay is good but be prepared to give up your life in return for it.

If you are desperate, you'll need a thick skin and not get too angry.\\u2019 If you can get into a good group of people and know some managers, you can always get hours due to staff not wanting to work. You can be terrible at your job and no one will do anything about it. You can be great at your job, but you won't get recognition. I try to engage with other team members in other departments, but I am ignored most of the time. Be prepared to face this if you are somewhat introverted. Be an extrovert and you might find a small clique you can interact with. Process changes often and you are not given clear instructions or information. Everyone passes off jobs to others and does not follow up.\",\"\\u2018Really loved the time I worked with them.\\u2019 I had a great time with Coles Services.

Getting full time is pretty much impossible unless you are in management (which is unlikely for most people, unfortunately). I understand that managers have managers too, but the ones in store are always ruthless, cutting hours. Also if you work more than your contracted hours, you dont get paid\",\"\\u2018I  have left Coles management and wont be going back\\u2019 Coles gave me very quick opportunities to move forward into higher roles. Through the management team you can easily gain footing in a department managers role even with 0 training. Management team has a very high expectation of your work output. Even with as little management experience as 2 months I was expected to complete all tasks effectively and complete overtime hours without pay. With very minimal training or advice you are expected to achieve results and targets that are not even explained to you. Along with this i never received a management salary even after 6 months of management work. I had to chase people around to get the money i deserved as all they look for is ways to save money.\",\"\\u2018Working with coles is hectic.\\u2019 When you work at retail it gives you oppoutunity  to interect with different people.

Being in night fill meant I could study during the day and work at night. Time demands - efficiency was the most important thing (obviously, in such a big chain store) so a lot of the times I wouldn't get all my breaks, I would push myself physically the whole shift which affected other aspects of my life.

Physically demanding, but not many responsibilities. Working with demanding bosses and members of the in-club who did not pull their weight. Guys get given the heavy lifting to do, while others do the lighter work. Thus wrecking your body while others get it easy. It is unfair to ask more of those who work the hardest.\",\"\\u2018Unfortunately, working at Coles took up a significant part of my life, of which I will never get that time back.\\u2019 There are some good benefits and perks when working at the Coles head office. There are some excellent people to work with as well. There is an expectation of a minimum 40 hour week (often 45+ hours per week), with no paid overtime (unless agreed with your manager prior to commencing overtime). The Coles head office isn't easily accessible via public transport, that is, unless you happen to live somewhere along the Glen Waverley train line or can catch a bus along Tooronga Road.\",\"\\u2018I have met some of the worst and best people at Coles.\\u2019 Good store culture. Everyone feels comfortable with saying hello and a quick chat with everyone else, regardless of what department you are from. Often mismanaged. Coles seems to promote people who aren't the best at their job. So while the staff are great, the managers are often slightly lackluster.\",\"\\u2018Definitely an experience.\\u2019 I like working with the people here. My fellow workers are nice and you feel like you are working in a mini family. There is always something you can talk about and an opportunity to make new friends even though people may come and go. Work is always hard and ongoing. Dealing with customers can be quite challenging and difficult at some times. Each department has its own perks and challenges. If you work in a couple of departments you need to be flexible.\",\"\\u2018A good fulfilling job to make a living where positives usually outweigh the negatives\\u2019 Flexible hours and work with great people, build skills and make friends.

Hard to develop your career past store level, senior management only promotes if you are \\\\\\\"known\\\\\\\".\",\"\\u2018Great pay but is it worth it?\\u2019 Coles helps you advance your career and pays extremely well for its salaried employees. If you work hard you get opportunity For salaried people, 12 hour days are Common and often days are longer than that again. You must be happy being at work early in the morning and late at night, overnight are common too. Little regard is given to academic qualifications. You need to be able to self promote and talk a good game, this is often more important than actual skills.\",\"\\u2018Horrible\\u2019 There were a large amount of enthusiastic and happy staff members. It provided a basis for skill development, such as customer service, communication, management, etc. Working with close minded management - There was a lot of negative comments made about customers, abuse of other staff members. I wasn't presented with an opportunity for career development - after 3 years and at the ago of 22 I was still casually employed and struggling. Management would not move me to part time or present me sigh equality or stability even after I proved long term commitment. I was also refused my right to resign - fair trading had been contacted on a regular basis.\",\"\\u2018Great environment, great co-workers and great customers\\u2019 The working environment is fantastic with a great mix of personalities The work is great, trying to understand the customers with the many nationalities that shop at our store, is a bit of a challenge, but I thoroughly enjoy being able to assist them with their inquiries.\",\"\\u2018Hard work but really enjoying it so far!\\u2019 As a delivery driver, I get to be out on the road, enjoy the weather and listen to my own tunes.\\r\\nEveryone helps each other and it's a great atmosphere.

Margins are always kept low, so too are the wages.\",\"\\u2018Really good\\u2019 You can work flexibly between multiple departments and can gain a wide range of skills. Penalty rates apply for sundays, and you get a 5% discount at Coles related stores.

This means i can juggle life and work. My roster revolves around me and not the other way around. Luck of developmental programs.\",\"\\u2018Been more than 5 years already but recently with the overhauling of management, opportunities are running out.\\u2019 It is a large corporate so lots of internal opportunities. Since it is a large corporate, IT Systems are now in the verge of un-maintainability and most of it are becoming legacy. Doing quality automations on application systems are almost quite impossible. If you're looking for things like AWS, SaaS, Cloud Computing, you rarely experience that here.\",\"\\u2018A positive entry into the workforce.\\u2019 It was an extremely supportive environment with excellent training.

Working at different stores can be challenging, because not all of them are at the same level.

The majority of people were wonderful to be around. Upper management seemed to have a problem with me enjoying my job, always looking down their noses at me. If you work well its more likely you will get stuck in the one job and not move around much. Great team members often get cranky with managements attitude and move away into other jobs.

The ability to work in different departments.. Working with new management all the time. In particular store managers and second in charges. Too many changes with rules and requirements. They don't appreciate staff that had been there a long time. Too busy telling us we are easily replaced.\",\"\\u2018Working there is definitely positive but could be improved with time.\\u2019 Good organisation and the breaks, its a big company that has all the small parts of employees jobs figured out. Its difficult to keep up the work load of life and work, not because the work is hard but working regularly. Not having enough to do during work sometimes.\",\"\\u2018That's why I pick Woolies.\\u2019 The teams' attitude and work ethic is great and it really boots your confidence when communicating with customers all the time. There are always going to be people that are hard to work with but that can easily be avoided if you consult your manager.\",\"\\u2018Would do it all over again.\\u2019 Over my 11 year tenure with Woolies, I felt my experience was unique as I didn\\u2019t always do just my job description. Dealing with some people were challenging, as they were challenged with change, \",\"\\u2018I spent three years there at Alcolizer and would say it was a great experience during my tenure there. Unfortunately I had to leave due to moving interstate. Overall, it was a very interesting and enjoyable workplace experience. You develop a skill set th\\u2019 -Great working environment with very good support from co workers\\n-Get to travel and meet new people from clientele base, from metropolitan to rural areas.\\n-Great remuneration as they offer excellent training and support\\n-Company notebook, ipad and business phone provided.\\n-Petrol subsidy and accommodation for extended travel -A lot of driving so be prepared to service your car more often. However that is not too bad thing if you like driving.\\n-Expect the unexpected, the workplace is very dynamic. However it will allow you to thrive and grow when you go into the deep end.\",\"\\u2018Fun and supportive environment to work in\\u2019 I absolutely loved working at Woolworths. All my managers were fantastic and supportive of my studies outside of work. When it came to shifts I was able to work comfortable hours and there was always opportunities to pick up some extra hours, particularly during holidays. The staff were fantastic and I have made so many frienships over the years. After working with the company for so many years there was always new things to learn and opportunities to further my skills and development. Sometimes you would come across some difficult customers but it comes with experience when dealing with them. At the end of the day you want to deal with the situation as efficiently as you can and hopefully they leave the store satisfied.\",\"\\u2018Long shifts, hard work, ok pay, protected rights\\u2019 Once you get the job, you're pretty unlikely to be fired. They have a very good union, so your rights (breaks, holiday pay, non-bullying, guaranteed hours, etc) are protected. If you show up and work hard you'll probably end up being promoted. It's a supermarket. You'll work hard the whole time. You're on your feet all day. Long shifts. High expectations to learn quick, work very hard, and do things perfectly and quickly. Depending on your store, the staff room and staff bathrooms can be anything from very pleasant to horrifying. Everyone shops for food so you encounter every kind of customer and not all of them are respectful or kind.\",\"\\u2018Forever changing and \\\\\\\"improving\\\\\\\"\\u2019 Flexible and diverse working environment. Good job to have as a gateway into retail. Possibility for a career higher up in retail with the help from Woolworths graduate programs. Training of staff and management could be improved. Difficult to keep up in the evolving retail market with new competitors\",\"\\u2018If I cared for my friend or family member I\\u2019d never let them work there - it\\u2019s all take for very little reward \\u2019 Interactive with the customers was good  Nearly always under staffed and so much added pressure- very little thanks for the efforts from senior management budgets way too little - salary with the hours worked out less than the checkout operator most times no one had breaks\",\"\\u2018Good job for a work/life balance\\u2019 A big team, and a good, relaxed job to have to be able to fit in everything else you want in life. You don't take the work home with you. The retail side of it can get frustrating, dealing with difficult customers. It also could be quite a tiring job at times.\",\"\\u2018Worked at Woolworths for 11 years what can i say it was very enjoyable and made some great friends over the years\\u2019 Plenty of departments  to work in to get a range of experience. Pay rate is very good , a great place to meet new people amd create new friendships Can get very busy at times especially holiday periods , can be very challenging when shifting departments for the first time but there's always a helping hand somewhere to help\",\"\\u2018Great for studying or at school, less so if wanting a fulfilling or satisfying career\\u2019 I would consider the pay to be quite good for this type of business. I know people who work full time 5 days a week at other companies and earn not much more than a part time salary on less days at Woolworths. Although sometime made to feel guilty for taking time off, they are usually accompanying and will try to give the time off if needed. Staff are only rewarded based off if they are considered a 'favourite' rather than merit or work ethic. Bosses must have things their way regardless if things are already running smoothly. Gossiping is a huge problem as everyone still acts like they're in high school. Is more stressful than what people may think employees endure. Verbal abuse is expected on a weekly basis at best.\",\"\\u2018When I started I was proud to work for the company, but over the last 5-7yrs it's has been a race to the bottom in the never ending war with other retailers. Little long term vision from upper management, very reactionary instead of being proactive.\\u2019 Staff discount, option to salary sacrifice to purchase shares. You are only a number, and the higher you go up the chain, the less you are treated with respect. Management try to find any loophole to avoid paying wage staff their full entitlements, union do not stand up for staff who most need it.\",\"\\u2018I would definitely work there again or encourage others to work there but would appreciate some variation.\\u2019 I liked the other people I worked with and most of the supervisors were fair, but more specifically I appreciated that they accepted schooling as more important and were understanding if I was late due to assignments etc particularly in my final year of high school. Working around schooling. Also, the repetitive nature of Service Checkout- maybe if they allowed 'checkout chicks' to rotate and work in different departments every now and then. Also a better solution to \\\\\\\"calling supervisors\\\\\\\" than a bell as it is often not heard.\",\"\\u2018Great Place to Work.\\u2019 Great mix of people. Generally pretty accomodating when you need time off, and plenty of opportunities available. While easy enough to get time off, once you're over 18, it's hard to pick up extra hours of work, as they tend to want to give the hours to younger and cheaper staff.\",\"\\u2018I have a experience of feeling content knowing that i have completed everything askrd of me while working consistently.  I also have a experience of acceptance from the customers .and a experience of great friendships with other staff.\\u2019 I work in a safe environment.  I am out of the sun and in air conditioning.  I like my customers and they recognize me and like me.  I feel appreciated by them.  I am energetic so my actice job where as i am always moving suits me.  I like the fast energetic work which keeps me fit.All the staff at work are great and we all work as a team. The challenges at work are continuous.  As every night is a challenge to get all the work done.  We all work as a team  to comllete everything and leave the store in good xondition.\",\"\\u2018It was life changing and definitely worth it.\\u2019 I had great manager who allowed me to work more when I needed to make more money by offering me opportunities to pick up more shift or even pull in more overtime. I work hard and my efforts were rewarded.\\r\\nI had a great work life balance as the split shifts allowed me baclcnce my work and private life without losing any money. I could opt to do afternoon if I had things on during the day and vice versa. My family too loved the fact the I could schedule my life around them. I didn't have any, if I really had to pick one it would be that my place of work was a bit far and that there was no public transportation at that time, so much hen I had a  break down on my car, it made thinf s a little bit harder to make the early morning, or late finish. I only suffer a major break down once but once Imy car was on the road again everything went as perfectly as before.\",\"\\u2018Overall I really enjoyed my time at the company, I have made some great friends and learned some important life skills that I can take with me to any workplace.\\u2019 I enjoyed the stability and the working environment. The staff were my colleagues and my friends.\\nThe pay was fair and the opportunity to move between work types was a simple conversation to get the process started! Trying to transfer stores was a tricky process as was securing those awesome public holiday shifts. \\nMy store in particular was very accommodating to my use of public transport and would cater shifts to suit me but sometimes that would hinder  the amount of shifts I would get offered as a Casual.\",\"\\u2018During my time at woolworths I learn't alot but it isn't for everyone.\\u2019 If you have a great manager like I did then you will be supported and enjoy working here but if you have a bad manager than you will have a hard time. You are expected to do a lot with little to no help. Customers can sometimes be extreme but remember that there are great customers too!\",\"\\u2018Great working environment\\u2019 Working with Woolworths was a great opportunity, even though I was there for a work experience, but I have learnt a lot, healthy working environment, happy people, free of discrimination and great and helpful employees, I like the way they operate their customer service system. Everything is a challenge to me.\\r\\n- how they work\\r\\n- how they deliver their service\\r\\n- how they treat people (both employees and customers)\\r\\n- the way they communicate\",\"\\u2018A decent and enjoyable job with a great team\\u2019 Its a very sociable and enjoyable job.  I met a lot of new and interesting people and everyone works well together as a team. There is a fair pay for the tasks that need to be performed with a good amount of break time. Sometimes trying to get further in the industry can be challenging and competive. It also can become quite mundane sometimes and doesnt challenge your brain much. Customers can also get a bit much to deal with.\",\"\\u2018Great Pay though unsupportive management\\u2019 AMAZING PAY, and the job is relitivky easy for the pay you get being a school student! Hours are flexible and their is always shifts available. Management is not support of the importance of school studies so never commit to too many shifts as they will expect this of you during exam time (they don't let you not show up for study time)! Business over employees\",\"\\u2018I want my 10 years of my life back.\\u2019 Most Woolworths stores have genuinely hard workers that are down to earth and look out for each other. Promotions are non existent. Work load is unbelieveable. Expectations are too high. Assistant department managers get paid hardly anything  more than a standard full time worker yet the work load they expect you to achieve is a joke. A lot of the time they never acknowledge how much extra work you end up doing in your own time to get the job done.\",\"\\u2018Overworked, underappreciated, impossible expectations.\\u2019 The money, and a few team mates Lack of support and no oppurtunity to improve, any ideas that could offer improvement were shut down, no opportunity to Manage my own team, aways micromanaged, spoken to poorly, no positive feed back always looking for the negative, expected to work more than paid and understaffed on purpose, no support to performance manage my team. Stuck in the old ways that no longer work.\",\"\\u2018Good people, challenging management, little pay.\\u2019 As with most places the best thing about them are the people you work with. Generally speaking immediate management are approachable and fairly easy going. The 5% staff discount can also help cut down those grocery bills. Customers are always going to be challenging but what makes it harder is always having to be on your toes about the continual 'undercover' staff reviews. This is compounded by Woolworths continual shifting goal expectations and focuses! If ou are coming back from time off then you had best have a chat with your immediate manager about store focuses and what they are 'keeping an eye out for'.\",\"\\u2018Good job, understanding management.\\u2019 Nightfill at Woolies allows me to study(uni) during the day and still earn money to keep my car running and pay for textbooks etc. Woolies are very understanding that during semester I am unable to work extra hours and need time off during exam times Sometimes I feel like we get the short end of the stick in regards to many things that are meant to involve the whole store. In saying that though, for the first time last year, Nightfill was given a separate budget so we could have our own Xmas do.\",\"\\u2018My experience was pleasant, the only reason I left was due to the fact I needed more hours and they could not cater to my needs.\\u2019 Base salary is good as well as the bonds you form with peers. Working in a variation of departments was a great experience also. There is no real challenges at Woolworths.\",\"\\u2018I may have left, but my woolies family would always welcome me back in a time of need.\\u2019 The people, Managers and colleagues are friends you will make forever. The opportunity to work in different departments/stores/roles and grow as an employee is great because you get to experience variety. The job is very secure and flexible. The large amount of staff means you are able to get time off when you need it. If you move, there is always a woolworths to work for! Early mornings and late nights, and of course a customer service job comes with bad customers, you can't do anything about that! The job can become a bit repeatative which is why working for different departments for variety is beneficial.\",\"\\u2018It was a great start to the work force but the pay rate was pretty low.\\u2019 Meeting new customers, learning more about customer service easily, learning new skills like money handling, etc. Meeting new work mates and extended management team. Giving a customer a great experience.. Because you never know what mood their in, but then again, if their in a bad mood, your customer service skills could change their day!\",\"\\u2018I felt valued and looked forward to every shift in my checkout operator job at Woolies.\\u2019 I started working at Woolies in my 60\\u2019s! Seriously! I worked with a variety of people and NEVER felt out of place. I looked forward to seeing my customers, too and I felt they looked for me, in a friendly sort of way, and this was an incredibly good feeling after working in another job (at the same time) where I endured a toxic and depressing supervisory experience! After a fall (not at work) I started to have some difficulty with the physicality of the checkout operator work. And unfortunately had to resign.. Eighteen months after my hip replacement I believe I could go back to Woolies but other family responsibilities (looking after an elderly parent) make it impossible to go back.\",\"\\u2018Diverse, flexible, accommodating and happy place to work.\\u2019 The team environment everyone works together to get the job done. No task is too hard to achieve. Management work with you to help with making sure your working environment is the best situation for yourself to make sure a good work life balance is achievable. My personal experience the only challenge  I have is the distance I drive from home to where I work. I am currently on a contact list at a couple of other stores so as soon as a position that matches my current position comes up I can get a transfer. This is also something that they try very hard to accommodate for their staff.\",\"\\u2018I'm very proud of my job.\\u2019 Professional work good pay & lots of things to learn to find more work. Being able to work at other stores makes me learn more & earn more. It's great flexibility makes it a very handy job. Trying new things, & working new times. All I can say is the job it self isnt much of a challenge but getting it was. It was very important to keep contacting them & be very persistent.\",\"\\u2018I have worked in many different places, some who make you work extra hours and don't pay for them, some don't pay penalty rates. I keep returning to Woolworths as I know they pay fairly.\\u2019 They pay you for every minute you work\\nThey pay penalty rates\\nOH&S is always a priority \\nFriendly environment, most of my co-workers are like family Hours being cut ( often short staffed)\\nYou are often made to feel replacable\",\"\\u2018Best place if it's your first job because then you never go out and look for another.\\u2019 Dynamic atmosphere with unity in diversity.\\r\\nGood for developing excellent communication and managerial skills. Beat the clock and show what you can really do. Pull up your socks because working in woolworths supermarket is not as easy as it looks. But with time you learn and it gets better and better.\",\"\\u2018Overall experience is significantly good.\\u2019 I learn to interact more to people as a customer service and somehow improved my English ability to speak, listen and understand. Every customer has a different personality that I need to be smart in handling customer complaint, etc. Including angry customer and dishonest customer.\",\"\\u2018It's a good job with very little stress and great people.\\u2019 Customer contact and workmates are great.  Happy environment in our department and the job is secure, simple and straightforward which suits my stage in life.  Always busy in a lively atmosphere where most of the workers share a good sense of humour. Working to achieve the amount of work required in the least amount of time with least possible staff.  Forever hearing the word 'budget' and 'wages cut'. Store manageress is not particularly good at dealing with people and is a poor example of professionalism.\",\"\\u2018Not a bad company\\u2019 It's a well known company recognised internationally. Coworkers are kind and pay is good. If I want to move up in the company it would be easy to do so. I can take a good amount of annual leave. Flexible hours to work and reasonable hours per week. Customers can be difficult therefore making the shift difficult. It's a busy and fast paced environment and we have to keep up with the expectations of the company and customers. Managers and customers are sometimes intimidating.\",\"\\u2018Welcoming progressive organisation with lots of opportunity for growth\\u2019 Very friendly and welcoming culture, lots of opportunities for personal development and career growth and workplace flexibility.  Mammoth matrix organisation to get your head around, excessive meetings and clunky approval process. \",\"\\u2018Very flexible and a good environment to grow as an employee\\u2019 The team environment \\nthe management team and the vision they have for the company is clear \\nThe flexibility of hours and how easy it is to discuss your availabilities with who is in charge \\ntheir constant desire to challenge your ability to work and to make sure you work at high and efficient standard. Getting to know the store in a manner that helps me do my job in a more efficient way \\nTying to keep up with the amount of load we had to replenish during some nights. This caused us to change working pace for different nights of the week.\",\"\\u2018It's a great diverse place to work, given you seek opportunity.\\u2019 Flexible hours, diverse positions, the ability to move around stores, training programs are great. Challenges can be overcome with communication with management. Difficult customers eg theft can be a huge challenge\",\"\\u2018Great place to work\\u2019 There is definitely opportunities to develop if you want them, however they become limited the higher you go. The team members are all really great. You can learn and develop a lot. Management can be poor at times and tend to turn a blind eye to issues. Often very short staffed and the role is very physically demanding.\",\"\\u2018Great first job, loved the opportunities, but you live to work, not work to live when you take any management position there.\\u2019 Good for a first Job\\r\\nGives opportunities for future\\r\\nSuitable for all types of people, eg. Mothers, students, elderly\\r\\nGood atmosphere, in the stores I have worked at\\r\\nGood for building confidence and self-esteem in regards to work ethics Mostly for the management positions, long hours and no recognition\\r\\nStaff cutting\\r\\nDecreased Hours\\r\\nNew rules so frequently\\r\\nNew changes which cost the business money and not neccessarily good for the business nor staff or customers.\",\"\\u2018Over all it is a good place to work, but some things out of your control make it a little harder than it should be\\u2019 The two store managers are both great people, easy to get along with and help you out wherever they can. Also the flexibility in the ability to work in various components of the store is great, as I would often get bored doing the one job so to be able to do something different in the store every now and then helps to like my job The most challenging thing would have to be dealing with the atmosphere of all the staff that work there.. for some reason its very negative and it makes it very hard to want to come to work when not everybody has a positive vibe and wants to be there\",\"\\u2018From great to terrible.\\u2019 The staff that are employed by woolworths are a great bunch of people. Its just the management that let the company down Trying to complete jobs with a unreasonable store management team and the loss of wages and a increased work load.\",\"\\u2018A valuable entry to the workforce and top opportunity for career advancement\\u2019 Working with all different kinds of people, making new friends while working, management push valued employees to aim for higher positions within the company, responsibility given to trustworthy staff, good introduction to life situations and interacting with people. Training programs high quality For all the quality management personnel there were, there was an equal number of managers who either didn't deserve to be in the position they were, took advantage of their position, or were just plain hopeless. Head office managers had lost touch with what it was like to be at store level\",\"\\u2018Working at Woolworths is something I'll never forget, I made amazing friends and faced challenges I never thought I could overcome, but I did and I have absolutely no regrets.\\u2019 The staff, the new people you meet every day, and the great opportunities the job hands you. The biggest challenge would definitely be having to face customers that aren't very nice, but after a while of working there you get used to it!\",\"\\u2018My experince has been a good one as i feel that i am a valuled employee as i have been asked for my recommendation on projects and management turn to me for help with certain things.\\u2019 The people who you work with are the reason you keep going back to work. they are always such a lovely group of people and even when times are tough you know you make lasting friendships to get you through. Certain times of the year are more hectic then others and so that makes getting your work done much harder. But with the help of your team members it can be done.\",\"\\u2018Great if you are a junior or uni student. No pluses otherwise.\\u2019 Great for anyone under 20 because you are paid at junior rates and get all the shifts. Couldn't survive on supermarket wage being single income household with a mortgage. Ageism; extremely low pay; favouritism; casuals put ahead of permanent part time; expected to do too much in too little time; no recognition for any kind of experience i.e. probationers, juniors, seniors all paid same level regardless of prior work experience or life skills; insufficient, indifferent and inadequate training; double standards.\",\"\\u2018Good when you are young but ageism when you are older and wiser.\\u2019 The first 10 years was an enjoyable experience. When I fell sick with cancer, I was not supported and told to stand down from my salary position because at that stage I could not return to work for a few more months.\",\"\\u2018To sum up my experience working as an Order Picker, I would have to say it was personally the most challenging and rewarding working experience of my life, which I greatly miss.\\u2019 There was a high level of concern for health and safety at Woolworths Logistics, compared to other warehouses, it was top notch. Everyone treated equally. Maintenance for their equipment was always maintained to a high standard. The pay rate for their workers was great. The challenges were mainly came from trying to better yourself and your technique with order picking. Learning new skills, working in changing environments, between Ambient and Chiller. Working with such a large amount of people, different cultures, different upbringings, meant learning to be extra tolerant and understanding and patient.\",\"\\u2018Don\\u2019t make this a career \\u2019 It\\u2019s ok if you\\u2019re only here part time while studying but don\\u2019t work here full time. Department managers will usually try to accommodate you if you can\\u2019t work a particular day because you need to study. Co workers were nice Poor managers, lack of appreciation, no motivation, ignored when you did the right thing but punished when doing anything even remotely wrong\",\"\\u2018My career in Woolworths has been an interesting journey\\u2019 Great pay, team members, very rewarding, flexible hours, warm and friendly environment, very militant on safety. This is a very challenging occupation whether you are a store person or a shift manager........ We put pride in our work and try to achieve every target possible.\",\"\\u2018Great team but the structure has no room for growth or innovation\\u2019 Work in a good team and can develop skills for leadership within those teams. Can interact with customers and help solve inquiries and issues. The amount of pay per hour is quite high for the work load. Little room for innovation, growth or actual development. Management has little to do with skill and more to do with connections and is almost impossible to be fired, just moved to another store or position. Customers can be grinding and see you as an object not a person. Company overall sees you as a number.\",\"\\u2018My experience has been fulfilling\\u2019 Advertisement, and opportunity for participation, and expansion of your career being able to speak up and have your voice heard. Long hours and early starts, management being alittle to pushy when other things are needing to be done, busy time periods of the year examples, Christmas, Easter etc\",\"\\u2018Excellent whilst there.  But sorry they foced me out of my job!!\\u2019 Excellent opportunity for mature employees and great support.  I was employed for 3 years as a front end cashier (casual).  Unfortunately, my hours were reduced  to Masters collapse and they employed a lot of their staff.  i was disappointed!   Customer service to agressive and impatient customers\",\"\\u2018Woolworths is a great employer with the ability to offer many careers with great benefits for all employees.\\u2019 With so many divisions you have a huge amount of career opportunities when you need a change but can stay within the same company and keep all your entitlements like sick pay. Retail is a challenging environment & you need to be able to accept change and work with it.\",\"\\u2018Overall, Woolworths are a good company to work for.\\u2019 I can see how I have grown and developed in this role, in particular with my interpersonal skills. I have become very confident dealing face to face with a wide variety of people, across different ages and ethnic backgrounds. \\n\\nMy managers have been, for the most part, very easy to get along with.  Their directions and instructions have been clear. They are approachable, easy to talk to. and good to work with. My role can be tiring, since I spend my entire shift on my feet.\\n\\nSome customers can be rude. Others can be difficult, and demanding.\",\"\\u2018The best introduction to the worforce.\\u2019 Amazing opportunities, amazing people, loved the fast pace, no two days were ever the same. As a first job I developed all my people skills, communication skills and how yo be responsible. As a manager, I was mentored by the best and always encouraged. Really long hours and incredibly stressful. There is a lot of pressure to work harder, faster, more efficiently. Budgets were imperative and it was just really busy and full on.\",\"\\u2018Not a life for the weak. hard work is all you need.\\u2019 Fast paced environment and very customer centric environment. Every day has its own challenges and you love the customer feedback. Retail is a challenge, try and keep everyone happy! Not enough hours in the day and not enough money to spend to make it a perfect place to shop. You are the last in the chain and have to make it all happen for the customers, the managers, the team and the support office.\",\"\\u20187 years down, many more to go!\\u2019 At my store, we all get along so well, i doesn't even feel like i'm at work some days. I've been given the opportunity to extend my personal and career growth by being selected to take part in and obtain my cert 4 in retail management, with all training and support supplied by the company. Retail is a challenging industry to work in if your not a people person. But don't let it get to you. There is plenty of support to back you. Like every workplace, they may be people you don't see eye to eye with, but woolworths offer many great ways with policies and procedures to sort it out.\",\"\\u2018When you are a team member things are better than when you are management.Once you are management you become just a number expected to do a million things in a small time frame.\\u2019 The team members and customers. Management from the store manager up.\\nThe budget , trying to get everything done with minimum team members and then being expected to stay back and finish all the work with no overtime and no thanks !\",\"\\u2018It has been, and still is, a fantastic place to work!\\u2019 They are really flexible and understand you may have other commitments and are willing to work around that. The staff are awesome, everyone is so friendly. I have worked as a cashier at Woolworths for 3 years now and this job has enabled me to buy my first car. It has been a fantastic job. It's very rewarding speaking to customers and having them acknowledge how hard we work. I highly recommend working at Woolworths. Shifts can be long - 8,9,10 hours of standing at a register. However it is broken up with breaks. Some may find the early/late shifts a challenge. There are always challenges when working in customer service. Having to deal with complaints or unhappy customers has been quite challenging. However times like these are quite rare.\",\"\\u2018A great starting point to build your skills\\u2019 The career change opportunities and the general attitude of most staff within 3 different stores across Australia The biggest challenges found at time would be the upper management of certain stores\",\"\\u2018Very experienced with customers service in retail\\u2019 Was a excellent company to work with, five years ago if I won Lotto i maybe would consider still work for them on a casual base, the last three years after 28years working for the company it's been the worst year of working with them Had great challenges with them that probably why I've worked with them for over 28years, I've got move to other stores or new department and I enjoyed this it was new,new people, new role etc that's why I'm asking for a new careers with other customers ,companies etc\",\"\\u2018Great place to work with flexibility and support!\\u2019 Flexible working hours, perfect for parents and student. \\nCareer advancement always possible for hard workers. Sometimes have to deal with rude customers!\",\"\\u2018Working in a team environment under pressure has helped me to better able to prioritise and to have an idea for my own personal experience when coping with stress of every day life.\\u2019 Not too stressful, flexible hours around my specific needs and close to home. Also I am able to transfer to different store or department within woolworths. Doing tasks allocated by management and trying to help customers at the same time. When not every staff member is pulling their        weight around completing specific tasks.\",\"\\u2018Woolworths is a fun supermarket to work for, there is never a boring day!\\u2019 Everyday has the potential for new things. You get to know and see so many different people. There is always a buzz. Staff are friendly and there is never a boring moment. Working on public holidays, like Good Friday is always hectic. Overcoming a customers bad experiences and replacing it with a positive shopping experience. Open and Close shifts are really busy.\",\"\\u2018Great times, experiences and friendships made at this job.\\u2019 Very good place to work for guaranteed shifts and incentives (discount card etc). Great for a first job and to prigr as in the company. Lots of opportunities offered. Having to manage so many staff members while still having to assist customers. It's quite full on.\",\"\\u2018It was a simple yet rewarding place to work\\u2019 Good working environment, wonderful co-workers, simple tasks and there was a good system in place. It was great to get to know the locals. They were very nice and kind people who made working a pleasure. Some customers were really difficult and you had to be patient and understanding. At times it's easy to feel broken down when being belittled by customers but generally it's okay. other than that it wasn't difficult..\",\"\\u2018The Best Of Woolies\\u2019 What i really enjoy working at woolworths was learning how to service customers at the cash register and baking in the bakery. The challengers were to use your skills to bring to the work place, and using your physical to develop with things i can do.\",\"\\u2018Career stagnation is a huge issue. \\u2019 The atmosphere and people you work with. Management and upper management. Career development is a challenge, in my experience it was never based on performance or results it was based on how well you got along with management above you. All so a lot of older people filled upper management roles and never moved on which hindered younger up and coming people.\",\"\\u2018Better jobs out there\\u2019 They are flexible, good for students. you'll see some interesting things. you get a whole 5% (FIVE) staff discount! The work/pay ratio is bad. probably the worst type of customers you will come across. you will injure yourself more times then being a full time wrestler. its hard the have problems solved by management\",\"\\u2018Love love love it\\u2019 I have been there next week for 4 years I have done multiple jobs as I love learning to do new things just love it.  Helping my team mates and making the customers\\u2019 day\",\"\\u2018I learr value driven management style. Internalised jim collins good to great\\u2019 Great learning ground, fast pace, innovative to push to the limits cheaper, faster, better. Always seeking staff to know the business well to improve their delivery to business Sometimes pushing the cheaper faster does not beget better. But its the nature og the business with retail being able to deliver cheaper product better served\",\"\\u2018Great place to start your career\\u2019 Great staff customers lovely our store was open 24hours a day in Victoria.if you have the skills you can advance up the ladder.you can start from the ground and work your way up the ladder it becomes a career not just a job. Very challenging,if you got what it takes challenge yourself  it can be rewarding.\",\"\\u2018A reminder of where I wouldn't like to work.\\u2019 Having a discount card and working with my friends. Polite customers were always the best thing about my days working at Woolworths. Working in the freezer and cold section constantly, resulting in coming to work sick often.\",\"\\u2018Great job! I'd like to work there again.\\u2019 There were a lot of good things, the people I worked with were great and very friendly. The different departments I worked in were fun! There are great opportunities toove around the store. Of course with any job there are challenges. But the biggest I would have to say for myself would be being under the pump with a lot of customers and a lot of work to be done. But it's all worth it.\",\"\\u2018Despite the narrow time frames, it's always a pleasure working at Woolworths\\u2019 Fantastic camaraderie, great to work with, friendly, helpful. LOADS of help and advice. Trying to keep up to date with Head Office amendments - they don't always work well on the shop floor. Sometimes not enough hours to go around. Time management is often a REAL challenge!\",\"\\u2018My experience has been average, it would be better if they could give me better contracted hours as I'm no longer at school\\u2019 Learning new things \\nDiscounts Getting more hours or contract hours\",\"\\u2018It's a job.\\u2019 I like that I go to work do my job and then come home no stress or after hours worries. I take school holidays off without pay to be with my kids and they accommodate me so I can do this. You get to know the regular customers and can have a good relationship with them. To do the same mundane job day after day. Management are forever changing and they don't introduce themselves and often won't even acknowledge you with a hello.\",\"\\u2018Great company with great people.\\u2019 Great people to work with and always opportunities for career progression. Good opportunity for a first job. Not always easy to transfer stores when relocating.\",\"\\u2018Working for Woolworths is thoroughly unrewarding\\u2019 Lots of break times compared to other places. Oh the challenges..... \\r\\nPutting up with the general public day in, day out. The customers are rude and don't even have the decency to use common manners. \\r\\nI can confidently say that not one person in the store I was at enjoyed their job.\\r\\nNot to mention the multi-million dollar company can only afford to give their staff a 5% discount.\",\"\\u2018Flexible. Friendly. First Choice.\\u2019 Best staff team, you make so many friends on top of the customers and just feel supported by another family. Like any retail job, time management and working efficiently are a must especially during our busiest times.\",\"\\u2018A more or less easy and fun job that is made into a high pressure, anxiety inducing job, by management.\\u2019 Work colleagues on the same level as you are often good to work with, that is, other people who are employed in the same job position. Customers are also usually pretty friendly so it's not a bad place to work in terms of most of the company. Tiring work for your body at the checkout. Very demanding on your feet and back as you have to stand for lengthy amounts of time with only small breaks on shorter shifts. Managers can be very cruel and put far too much pressure on workers instead of being kind and understanding human beings.\",\"\\u2018A fast paced, team friendly and learning and skill orientated career.\\u2019 A great rewarding company where you get paid and treated above and beyond for your hard work. A great working environment and a fantastic team culture, I feel excited knowing I work at Woolworths. A work life balance and essentially being one of the busiest businesses in Australia all year round. Different managers have different ways of doing things and making everyone happy can be tough.\",\"\\u2018Fair pay for repetitive tasks with no future career prospects. \\u2019 Good pay, management are nice enough. You will work the hours you are rostered on for, you generally don't need to stay back for anything.  No room for career progression, only those who the manager favours are offered such opportunities. Boring, repetitive work. \",\"\\u2018Great place to start for your first time for a job, requires a lot of energy so youths or early 20s are suited.\\u2019 Quick to learn \\r\\nGreat working environment \\r\\nGreat team members and managers who are friendly and give a helping hand when needed!

Pressures from management, and given extra work if you're not in their fit ,ie looks, social with them outside of work, or too passionate (outspoken)/lack of it, and a threat you may succeed them.\",\"\\u2018Easy job if your just a team member but hard work if you are a 2IC or department manager\\u2019 Flexibility with rostering.\\nSome of the co-workers.

Not the best place in the world to work but if you can secure a part time position it is guaranteed hours and they can be quite flexible. As with any job, I found the teams of people you work with can make or break it, but for the most part, it is an okay job. Working in a supermarket means you face a diverse range of customers, some of whom will look down upon people in the cashier role and not treat them very well. This was difficult to manage at some points. Also, middle management changed frequently, and each new manager had a different approach to running things, this was difficult to keep up with at some points, especially when large changes were implemented and then scrapped. Also, high incidences of being understaffed, whether due to budget or just low on staff members, this made the work stressful at times.\",\"\\u2018I loved working with my Woolworths family!\\u2019 There are so many opportunities with many different departments, if you decide you are getting bored then you can easily ask for a change of department or if you are looking for more hours there is always the opportunity to work in more than one The challenge that I found was that in my time there, there were many changes in management.\",\"\\u2018Working at Woolworths was the typical first job, easy to obtain, easy to actually work at, but little opportunity for development and low pay.\\u2019 Flexible hours, nice workers, relatively easy work.

Supermarkets are a terrible place to work where no decisions made on how to run the store are actually made at ground zero rather they're made in the eastern states and instructed via countless emails and work instructions. There is no such thing as a work life balance as you're expected to complete the work of 3 staff members in your one shift due to \\\\\\\"changes\\\\\\\" in procedures designed to make the task easier therefore requiring less hours to complete, to top it off when you work extra hours to complete said tasks as you're constantly judged and penalised on your inability to complete tasks given in what they (people whom have never even completed the task before themselves) deem necessary they \\\\\\\"performance manage\\\\\\\" you for having a poor work life balance.

Training is minimal to non existent. Long term career opportunities are few and far between, in fact they seem actively against it.

Staff have to fill in the gaps because the client is always kowtowed to.\",\"\\u2018Great opportunity to learn, however it is a tough journey.\\u2019 IBM provides a great opportunity to learn and grow. As the work environment is extremely fast pace, you can quickly learn skills at a pace that is twice as fast comparing to other companies. There are many opportunities internally, which allows you to move around in different roles and learn different areas of the business very quickly. The working environment is high pressured and tough. There are many layers of management and processes, which make it difficult to deliver certain tasks, which can impact the delivery timing and satisfaction to the customer. As a result of cost challenges and offshoring resources, the general quality of skill set is quite low, which also impacts the quality of delivery and reduces customer satisfaction. Work/life balance is a constant battle and near non existent as there is a certain level of expectation to work out of hours until a task is complete and the high pressured environment always keeps your mind ticking out of hours. There is no benefits/perks - things such as the company Christmas party has been abolished, and basics such as tea and coffee are no longer provided. As there are cost challenges, it is extremely difficult to obtain training or a pay rise.\",\"\\u2018IM here too surprise and delight!\\u2019 It was a apple inc call centre, all friendly, good training\\nAnd get a free apple shirt after training.\\nMy trainer was super nice, and patient.

I even took my work \\\\\\\"on the road\\\\\\\" with me when my wife wanted to visit her family for an extended weekend. As the only local member of a team which was managed in Sydney and had team members in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Ballarat, I found it quite isolating. When I went into the local office at Ballarat I was surrounded by people I did not know or work with nor have any interactions with. My human interactions were limited to the occasional voice chat with a close working colleague and weekly catchups with my manager, neither of whom I ever met in person.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe left Melbourne as a family and I took a significant pay cut to move to Ballarat to take up the opportunity with IBM. After being retrenched I was faced with moving back to Melbourne, commuting or retraining.

Constant opportunities to learn and receive career mentoring. Staff are often in multi-skilled roles for efficiency and to keep work interesting. But can also create competing interests for work and very high workloads. So work/life balance can be very hard.

Opportunities may exist for a varied and long career with smart people. Despite having some great people, there are certain individuals that drive a culture that can be driven by fear in an environment of great change. Like many businesses having the correct strategy can only drive great business outcomes if the execution is correct.

Their favourite phrase when I challenged their ways was \\\\\\\"it is what it is\\\\\\\"  therefore no vision for positive change at all. If I can sum up my experience there, I'd say people were genuinely lovely and friendly people. Employees lacked aspiration, motivation and passion for anything. They came in to do bare minimum and go home for their pay. No vision or direction for the future, leadership hated change even if it was positive.

A challenge that exists, and exists with each of the 'big six', is the ability to promote the pathways for career advancement beyond their own functional areas. As most of us develop into our careers, we alone understand and seek out our own pathway, but for graduates and those that are young in their careers, the vision of advancement tends to cease at the top of their own 'functions', rather than outside into new areas.

Therefore, you are able to rub shoulders with people in high positions and have the elevator pitch! Growth opportunities were stunted. In the name of gender equality, people were selected based on \\\\\\\"whom they know\\\\\\\" rather than \\\\\\\"what they know\\\\\\\".

My initial manager showed faith in my abilities and potential to grow, subsequently she promoted me to a position where i was the least experienced in the team but was able to prove my worth by meeting and exceeding the expectations and targets that were set. Following from above, the main challenge was proving myself worthy to my new and much more experienced colleagues.\\nAlso learning and becoming thorough with the technical processes the role involved.\",\"\\u2018My time at ANZ has provided me with exceptional customer service skills that I will continue to use throughout my career.\\u2019 The time they invest into training and development was notable.

Some management needed further training and development.\",\"\\u2018Currently not a great place to be an employee.\\u2019 Big company, large budgets, good salaries.

On top of this there are plenty of coaching and training sessions to ensure you're constantly improving and performing within your role. There are lots of employee benefits and discounts, as well as reward and recognition schemes to work towards. There's a lot of information/policies/procedures to retain and things are constantly changing, and I mean constantly! You always have to be on your toes, in particular from a risk and compliance perspective. There are many KPI's to meet and it's a very structured environment; you need to be doing what your schedule says you should be doing at the time it says you should be doing it to avoid causing a domino effect for other areas of the business.

Depending on business units and work environments (not necessarily reflective of the entire organization), my observations of the BU I worked for:\\n- Cost is still a major driver to people management, often at the expense of talented employees\\n- Lack of job design\\n- Traditional rather than transformation/collaborative leaders \\n- Transactional rather than relational employee-employer relationship\\n- Rigid process/policies/procedures, internal systems with pre-existing issues/bugs and lack of reliable tools for analytics in lending space are primary issues that impedes speed to market \\n- Requires improved management of change\",\"\\u2018Ruthless.\\u2019 Some staff discounts for insurance products, but they don't treat staff any better than any other customer when you need to make a claim. And if you have a banking dispute they will dare you to go to the ombudsman. Loyalty is not rewarded. \\nPoor commitment to training - they prefer to have other people pay for it and then hire it in. \\nIf you are a specialist in a particular area, they don't retrain you when they change technology, they just show you the door.\\n\\\\\\\"Activity based working\\\\\\\" (don't have your own desk) and poor building design leads to high transmission rates for airborne illnesses, and noise transmission makes it difficult to engage in \\\\\\\"deep work\\\\\\\" where you need uninterrupted concentration to complete complex or creative tasks.\",\"\\u2018Great career learning and opportunity, recommend to any young starter\\u2019 The company provide great trainings and opportunities are limitless if you are good at your job. The company accomodate the staffs often if they moved to another area or city. It has been quite a journey my 7 years with CBA.

Not my fault attitude of some vendor resources does not help project much.\",\"\\u2018Overall the job is ok, if you like sales and customer service you will enjoy the job. the only thing I didn't like is the pressure they put on you if the company isn't hitting sales targets and they only offer part time which is the downside.\\u2019 If you enjoy customer service and dealing with customers face to face then you will enjoy the role. you can get some nice perks working for CBA and could potentially get bonues if your branch hits target. There is a lot of pressure on sales so if you're not very confident with sales then I wouldn't recommend this role. CBA is very sales orientated and if you don't hit your target then you will lose out on your bonus. Also it's they make it hard to get full time work in a branch and mainly offer part time also To be honest the pay isn't the best\",\"\\u2018I treated all work colleagues regardless of position or title with respect, compassion and justice similarly for customers and as result I received delightful rewards and gained some wonderful insights into leadership roles and more importantly what makes\\u2019 I was always recognised for my work efforts and received delightful rewards.\\nWe had the opportunity to put forward suggestions for change and a team would review and implement them. \\nI was able to enjoy the opportunities of career development starting in a Customer Service Inbound Call Centre and moving onto a Change Management Analyst role and then to a Team Leader/Mamager role of various teams.

RDO every 3 weeks were a bonus. Banking changed in the late 1990's. It became a sell/sell industry.  The prestige of working for the bank disappeared, and you became a sales person. Definitely have to question some of the people who were promoted. Quiet achievers were always overlooked.  Footballers were always promoted due to status for the bank. Very disappointing going into a bank now and the branch manager now is mid 20's usually a graduate from University.  They have no idea what banking is about.\",\"\\u2018CBA is an amazing employer that sees potential in people and nurtures personal and professional growth.\\u2019 Very professional work place, feel valued as an employee, great incentives, heaps of staff perks and benefits, education and up-skilling, plenty of room and ecouragement to grow.

Incredible learning/development and career opportunities. Legacy fragmented tech stacks. Dated offices, though these are being improved.\",\"\\u2018All in all I have a great deal of respect for the organisation and it's leadership and it's mission/vision - I really enjoyed being a part of the organisation, I learned far more than I realised (which has been incredibly helpful in my new role at a small\\u2019 Good things: The people, the culture; the facilities (showers, kitchen space, coffee machine, breakout room); autonomy within your role and opportunities for professional development; celebrating the holidays, anniversaries and even rolling out new budgets and strategies; transparency from a leadership standpoint; not taking ourselves too seriously, not forgetting to have some fun in your role; company values that are adhered to (which is rare in a large organisation); leaders that will go that extra mile to try and accommodate requests; always working toward continuous improvement; the adaptability of the organisation in a increasingly challenging market whilst maintaining our ethical grounding... Personally, in my experience I felt there was a lack of support when I transitioned into a new role via a development opportunity which was a bit disappointing and left me second-guessing my ability.  \\nThen when my manager was dismissed there was a lack of leadership as my colleague who didn't have any management experience became my interim manager.  He had his hands full juggling his own work and trying his best to manage a team, and as a result our working relationship became a bit strained and I wasn't getting the support I required to deliver in my role to the level I wanted to.  I often felt like I was in the deep-end trying to manage a project beyond my experience level and often felt like I wasn't delivering any real value to the organisation.  I of course realise these things happen when departments undergo sudden change and have to adapt accordingly, but it left me doubting myself which is something I struggled with a bit when looking at new job opportunities post Seek Learning.\",\"\\u2018A great software development experience with a fun culture\\u2019 Great software development culture. All striving to do great things and everyone is accepting of everyone's strengths and weaknesses. There is a strong appetite to grow everyone's careers. Org structure is fairly flat and teams are mostly autonomous meaning we make our own product decisions and technology decisions with guidance. Great culture and people - parties are awesome. Salary and work life balance are absolutely amazing. You're able to work from home whenever you need and there is unlimited sick leave. The social culture I would say is fairly mediocre compared to other big companies. Teams are quite self contained and don't really get to know other teams so if you're in a team that doesn't get out much you're not going to socialise much unless you really branch out. Not the best for introverts in that sense. I've met some great friends here though who I fairly often see outside of work.\\n\\nSEEK legitimately only hire people if they're willing to challenge themselves and step outside their comfort zones.

Lack of support from management.  A lot of feedback is often fallen on deaf ears.\",\"\\u2018Optus has SO much potential and the people are great but the sales support including pricing systems need replacing. Possibly good to start at Optus now and hopefully ride the wave.\\u2019 There are a wide variety of roles to apply for at Optus - if you can gain your managers' approval to move out of where you are (even if a manager in the new area wants you to join his / her team). So many divisions to gain support from and it's like herding cats. There are some great people and managers though to be fair. Just not in my area of the business. Remuneration varies and was ok for me but sales targets impossible to achieve (so little chance of overachievement bonuses).\",\"\\u2018Once a great place to work, no more\\u2019 What's left of the staff - the people. Optus used to be a great company, with great people having fun while working. There are still a few around and if You can find them, it's still good. \\r\\n\\r\\nNeed to be Sydney based for career progression A very Sydney centric company that has lost its way over the past 3 years.

There are some very clever and talented engineers within the business. Some perks with phone and internet. As a business they do not adapt, care little for their people and think only of their bottom line. Managers spend all of their time managing up instead of their teams. No support from upper management.\",\"\\u2018I love working for Optus.\\u2019 At Optus, It's the people around you, who really make Optus, the best work place. If you are a person who is willing to take ownership of your own career development, then you will find support and guidance in your leaders. Besides the awesome discounts you get as an Optus employee, there's alot more that come your way at the work place, which really drives engagement across the business. This is really a multi cultural work place and everyone's opinion is valuable.  The Melbourne Office is ideally located close to Flinders Street station with a lot of coffee shops and eateries around. Opportunities for career development would really vary depending on yourself, if you have a pretty niche skill set / interest then getting ahead may be a challenge. But in the end it all comes down to you and the relationships you build though out the business.\",\"\\u2018Good place to work and your team often becomes your second family. Sometimes stressful but generally pretty rewarding\\u2019 Great team of people and you get to meet a lot of different people who you serve. Constantly learning about new technology and are able to help people save money which is very rewarding Stressful work environment at times, a lot of pressure to meet targets, customers can sometimes be difficult in dealing with, retail work so retails hours\",\"\\u2018A tricky and tough at times environment yet rewarding at the same time.\\u2019 Work colleagues, environment, friendly customers. A good sense of well being after helping customers with their products ensuring that they have a better understanding of it plus us being here to help them whenever. Going above and beyond really does give you a good feeling inside! Angry and disgruntled customers that have had a bad experience elsewhere with the company an take their aggression out on you.\",\"\\u2018So far so good!\\u2019 Customer first, first call resolution, lot of training, great benefits and perks, management who looks after and regular PDR Meet the high expectations at all times. Customer first.\",\"\\u2018I enjoyed my time at Optus and feel I have grown personally from the experience.\\u2019 The Optus campus is a great place with everything you need on site. Gym, child care, variety of food, entertainment, visiting dental and physios. A community atmosphere is all around. There appears to be too many senior managers and things can take a long time to get from concept to completion.\",\"\\u2018Optus is a great place to start your journey in sales but it becomes very competitive with external applicants to progress internally. \\u2019 Great team environment along with opportunities for commission Really REALLY low wage as it\\u2019s meant to be compensated by commission, however commission is almost as rare as a unicorn due to it being team based not individual. You can hit 200% KPI and still not get rewarded with commission due to your team not putting in the work\",\"\\u2018Disappointed with Optus overall\\u2019 Optus provides great training upon hire and support through a employee assistance program is fantastic. Work/life balance can be achieved working for optus. The main challenge I faced working at optus was incompetent management and micro management.  The talent hired could not reach their full potential or recieve and provide feedback to management.  Feedback was never welcome, and the workplace lacked diversity in staff and skills.\",\"\\u2018I would not recommend that staff apply for a role with Optus. It was great when I started but it has gone downhill hence me resigning from them.\\u2019 I really enjoyed with some of the staff that I worked with earlier on, however some staff that I worked with were INCREDIBLY unprofessional, I felt that I was pressured and NOT awarded for my hard work, I felt that some staff were given preferential treatment unfairly and upon my complaint about the way I was spoken to by other staff (I was embarrassed in front of other customers) Lack of staff always presented an issue, things were changed upon a daily basis and we were made to work off a script like robots therefore sucking our own personalities out of selling. Targets were increased in a sharp way, making it very difficult to obtain. If you missed your target by even one for the month, questions would be asked immediately and you would be looked upon that you were not doing your job correctly.\",\"\\u2018Career building and life long knowledge base.\\u2019 The teams and positivity for me were a massive perk! Having support around you by the franchise owner and team leaders. Great staff and I have now made life long friends and have built and gained so muck knowledge to do with team leader skills, inventory, customer relations plus so much more. Monthly and quartly targets were great to see where you needed to improve or where you were going well. Mixed customer groups that need to be trailered too accordingly.\",\"\\u2018Varied\\u2019 The people you meet and the friendships you make. \\r\\nYou can progress within the company and learn a lot but you need to put yourself out there and push for the training and development to achieve this goal. The challenge is that there are a lot of processes that need to be rigidly followed. Attention to detail is a mandatory skill to succeed.\",\"\\u2018Great relationships are formed with your colleagues\\u2019 SingTel Optus is an exciting place to work. The campus style feel makes it a fun environment to meet your colleagues and customers The perception of the SingTel Optus Network\",\"\\u2018Optus is shadowed by singtel administration and Singapore/Asian working culture which is against Australian and Western Corporate working style.\\u2019 I am unable to find any good things about working with Optus There is very distinctive line between Optus Employees and contractors who work at Optus. Optus failed to assume responsibilities for Contractors and there is no way Optus is hiring any new employees.\",\"\\u2018Optus is a company that cares for it's employees by building  great campus and offers a range of opportunities for career progression.\\u2019 The campus is great with onsite caf\\u00e9s, mobile store, physio, different food options for breakfast & lunch, a bar Getting to work and parking if you drive to work\",\"\\u2018Although the campus is good and people are nice, the old school way of looking at technology needs to change or top talent will go elsewhere.\\u2019 Sydney campus is amazing and plenty of meeting rooms to use, management are flexible, type of work is good and engaging The technology and facilities. Laptops given to employees are clunky, the SOE are slow and on old versions, behind in technology\",\"\\u2018Great place when I was there- has now changed a lot\\u2019 It was a great place to work in 2004 but then management changed and our group went through a bad stage. Billing systems and changing strategies\",\"\\u2018Don\\u2019t work there. \\u2019 Perks and immediate team, people go above and beyond to get things done.

Understanding the internal processes and dealing with International partners.\",\"\\u2018Could have been better.\\u2019 Discounts on all Optus accounts as well as a range of other services are great!

Complex projects with many stakeholders\",\"\\u2018Used to be fantastic, now only concerned about profit and cost reduction numbers\\u2019 Perks / benefits / discounts and working colleagues are amazing. Everyone there generally supports each other irrespective of the job you are doing. Managements sole concern is cost management & only known management style is micro-management.

The management is incredibly thoughtful and understanding of having a work/life balance. They also provide excellent training around their products and services. You go in prepared and with a lot of support. The targets are also achievable and if they see you struggling they want to actually help you! In previous workplaces with targets that I hadn\\u2019t hit management took that as an opportunity to put me down but not at Suncorp. They created an action plan straight away and assigned a trainer to me that I could talk to and questions to improve conversations to meet targets.  The job itself could get very boring. You\\u2019re essentially just asking set questions and filling out a response. Felt very mundane and autonomous after the first month.

They just don't have a clue about Client relationships and how to grow a business Senior management have never been through a recession and are trying to grow a business with less staff after a far reaching restructure that has destroyed the culture.

This used to be the most awesome place to work, but following the new CEO and almost complete turnover of  the senior leadership team, the organisation is not a good place to work. There is no positive culture, numerous restructures, lots of redundancies and cost cutting in the last 3 years, bad leadership and staff are no longer valued. Hopefully it will get better in the future, but many very good leaders have left the business.\",\"\\u2018While over the years I had some valuable experiences and learned much, the last few years were extremely stressful since the off shoring began.\\u2019 It is a large organisation and there are many departments. The company gives you 1 career day per year to try a different environment. You get 4 personal days per year to use as you wish. You are allowed 1 volunteer day per year to help a charity. The management style is very demeaning with little consideration of individual needs. Micromanagement is the norm and with the offshoring of many jobs, loyalty is a thing of the past. It is all about the money. There is no trust with management demanding a doctor's certificate for every sick day regardless. Job changes occur without explanation & or agreement. Opinions cannot be spoken without retribution.\",\"\\u2018An experience not to be repeated.\\u2019 Good support system between people doing the same role across the companies.

Good culture, good people on the whole Really slow to get things done. Sometimes you feel like you are battling the world.\",\"\\u2018It seemed like a good idea when offered the role, the experience was bad enough to drive me to resign from the Bank and take a completely different career path for 5 years\\u2019 The support for staff was good, the systems were quite good, processes were better than average, portfolio size was good, credit managers were helpful and willing to offer advice. Training was relatively poor, overall support for new staff was only adequate, sales culture was very intense, management was very sales focused at the expense of many other things\",\"\\u2018The good, bad and ugly\\u2019 The role always keeps me on my toes, policy changes and process changes make sure that I am consistently learning. Nab engage staff and create competitions between branches to keep staff engaged.\\nThere is always opportunity for advancement. Targets are a big thing at the NAB, if you work in a major city or a rural area they are the same.\\nSupport from management is lacking as they are currently demoting people and reducing hours as branches don't have the foot traffic as they used to.\",\"\\u2018The talk is talked but the walk isn't always walked in the right direction\\u2019 Embracing innovation, looking to the future, diversity pretty well covers all groups of society enterprise wide and is embraced and encouraged. Pockets of great people driving change in challenging environments. Leaders (middle) not always leading from the front with enthusiasm and a clear path to engage the team to follow. Sometimes seems that messages up the line don't make it through a wall of misinformation and lack of proper accountability for poor leadership behaviour and decision making (or lack of decision making).\",\"\\u2018My experience with NAB is it seeks to foster a positive working environment for its employees\\u2019 Career development once you have your foot in the door is available.\\nNAB supports the community and encourages staff 2 days per year (paid leave) to volunteer in the community. Challenges involve staff shortages as well as at times insufficient training of staff prior to commencing work.

I exceeded my targets especially as a home loan specialist. My challenge was competing with my colleagues   which I handled.\",\"\\u2018Best job ive worked at so far \\u2019 Great company to work for. Stable work life. They will try to work around you as much as possible. Most Shifts are rostered meaning it can be hard if you want to do a course in the afternoon as you can finish anywhere between 4.45-9pm\",\"\\u2018A great organisation to work for and I have nothing by good things to say about them.\\u2019 The different departments I worked in at NAB all had a terrific culture.  It was very important to all to work hard but then be rewarded both financially and with regular social events.  NAB were  very supportive of both myself and my family, when I was married.  In particular, NAB supported me above and beyond what you would normally expect of an employer.  In return, I was very loyal, right up until the day I was retrenched. The same as every other business.  Costs, costs, costs.  This is now having an impact on my ex-colleagues with several now worried for their jobs.  But this is not restricted to just NAB; it's market-wide.\",\"\\u2018I had 35 wonderful years working across the globe for the NAB group, made numerous friends and don't for one minute regret the experience.\\u2019 A well run organisation which generally looks after its people. Honest and collegiate atmosphere with good culture. Great opportunities to work across a wide range of areas/divisions. At times, too much emphasis placed on bottom line results with little thought given to the impact such has on individuals (eg forced redundancies and lack of trained staff). As with the broader banking industry, needs to continue work in building trust in the general community.\",\"\\u2018One of the best jobs in a long career of ups and downs.\\u2019 This team is not typical of your average area within NAB (nor most other corporations). It's closer to a Tiger Team environment, bringing rapid response DevOps approaches to a security environment. It's one of the most hard-hitting yet interesting work environments I've experienced in a long career. The whole environment is made up of fun nerds and geeks who truly enjoy working with each other. Please note that the categories I rated low are because I contract and am therefore excluded from these areas. As I understand they aren't bad for actual employees.\",\"\\u2018Loved working for the company, I worked with a great team and it never felt like work really.\\u2019 Great work life balance, most days your finished by 4:30! Very retail based and great incentives and team activities. The sales leads are a little tricky at times.\",\"\\u2018Only work here if you want to look good to future employers\\u2019 I worked in the customer service centre. Training was great, and colleagues were all fantastic. The best thing though, was probably that working at NAB made me more appealing to other employers. - Didn't actually know what the job was until my first day\\n- Constantly changing shifts. You're meant to know your shift a month ahead, but shifts have been known to change within 48 hours notice \\n- Miscommunication about shifts in application and interview stage \\n- Opportunities to move up in the ranks only available if you want to become a team leader \\n- Micromanagement of breaks\\n- The need to get to work and set up the computer 15 - 30 minutes before start time to avoid being \\\\\\\"late\\\\\\\" (with no overtime pay)\",\"\\u2018It was a great job and challenging too but felt undervalued as a casual.\\u2019 Provided training locally and I was paid for the training time, uniform provided. Co-workers very helpful and supportive in my training process. Enjoyed working in the position and customer service. Was grateful they employed me as a mature aged person. In the beginning of my employment I was told I may have the opportunity to gain permanent part-time work 3 days a week. They changed their mind and I was very disappointed. Also my hours were reduced in relieving and after not working for 3 weeks I was expected to drive to Orbost for 1 day's relief, being a round trip of 122 kms using my car and paying for petrol. They didn't reimburse travelling expenses because I was casual. I made 6 trips to Orbost over the 2 months I worked for them. I explained to the the Store Manager it was not viable for me to travel 122 km for 1 day, especially being unemployed. I have not been asked to work since then.\",\"\\u2018Shocking; i have have 2 roles within nab in the past 4 years, retail banking good luck trying to move up the chain without connection. business banking, be prepared to work for peanuts and pump out work way above your pay grade.\\u2019 The good thing is the team environment, they are structured to work like a family tree. Actually having the organisation coincide with your personal life\",\"\\u2018Great entry level position to see if the finacial industry is for you.\\u2019 Great salary, great location, extensive training, support on calls while in training, supportive managers, ability to upskill and gain further training in Personal banking products. Diversity and equal opportunity was evident. Work longer days to get a long lunch break. Heavily focused on KPI's. \\n\\n\\\\\\\"Non-Formal\\\\\\\" meetings which feel like they are just attacking your personality. \\n\\nTraining teams are split up once training is over and placed into multi-skill teams.\\n\\nIn my honest opinion, at times, it really felt like a high school yard.\",\"\\u2018It's work and it pays the bills, but if you want to work in a team full of people who are passionate about what they do, this may not be the place for you.\\u2019 They paid me......and that's about where the positives end. Really stifling culture\",\"\\u2018Never a dull moment when you're on a project\\u2019 NAB offers an inclusive environment that appreciates the skills that people bring to the table. It encourages diversity and is one of the more community minded large organsiations in Australia. Performance management leaves a lot to be desired.\",\"\\u2018Learning, laugh, memories\\u2019 Career progression: your out out is above and reaching your goals with your people leaders then new doors will be open when asked or given. Competing with the other major banks to make revenue for the business.\",\"\\u2018Poor onboarding to set you up for failure, wouldnt recommend to my enemy.\\u2019 Loyal Customers. Diversity and equal opportunity. I joined NAB after having served another big four bank for 14 years due to the close proximity of the NAB business centre I would be based out of, turned out to be the worst career move. Poor on boarding and the management had no clue on how to on board new to bank staff. My first formal training was booked in close to 3 months after I had taken up the role. Without any formal training I was asked to deal with a portfolio of clients within two weeks into my role, setting me up for failure. The portfolio was also vacant for 8 months before I was appointed so customers weren't happy and my work phone wouldn't stop ringing including weekends. Overall poor experience, wouldn't recommend NAB to my enemy. Also if you have an appetite for commercial lending don't get misled by NAB small business, their bankers courtesy handful of introducers just do home lending to business customers and achieve revenue targets. I saw no future at NAB and resigned in 4 months. The management showed a lot of desperation in me taking over a portfolio of disgruntled customers and sorting their issues which wasn't taken care of in the last 8 months.\",\"\\u2018The IT programme take to many short cuts,  and the out sources treat the truth very carelessly.\\u2019 Work balance, NAB do look after their permanent staff ( which I take my hat off to NAB). If you dont belong to one of the out sourcing companies,  your recommendations are dismissed,  and I have over 30 years in IT,  and finance.\",\"\\u2018Overly conservative and slow to adapt to industry changes\\u2019 People in the office generally are quite helpful in terms of sharing technical knowledge. \\nFlexible work arrangements.\\nValues diversity. \\nAll staff is encouraged to drive develop their own career Too many projects taken on by the organisation.

So the result was I had an amazing work life balance.\\n-some of the people are amazing -the culture hasn\\u2019t changed and doesn\\u2019t seem likely too.

At times, there seems to be a push to change things a lot of effort goes in to the planning but the execution of the planning then gets too messy with too many politics involved, or as I said above, with so many changes constantly occurring, the planning gets forgotten about because by the time we've planned, the need has gone.\",\"\\u2018Good people to work with though micromanagement is tough to deal with\\u2019 Management were good and understanding.

The benefits of working at Telstra are very wide  - there are financial benefits but also working for a company with such a strong reputation for technology and innovation is always a plus. For some people the size of the organisation can be a challenge\",\"\\u2018I love my job and I love working for such a well known and respected Telecommunications provider!\\u2019 Working for a Corporation which is dynamic and always growing and adapting to changing technologies and circumstances. As a contractor working for Telstra there are often a challenges due to the fact that there is a clear separation between Offical Telstra employees and contractors.

They are also incredibly devoted to working around my busy uni lifestyle to make sure I'm given enough time for exams and assignments. The challenges would be the patience required. Given how large the company is, we cater for a huge amount of customers and in that we are bound to deal with some dissatisfied people.

It's a reason why I did not change provider.\\u2019 Rewards and recognition..I enjoyed the relationship between the different areas of telstra who are all in for helping customers. I have learnt so much from the telstra technicians and they should be recognized and praised for all their hard work getting customers connected and representing telstra well out there in the community. WELL DONE TO ALL THE TELSTRA TECHS!!! What I found challenging was the service provided by some contractors and it was a big let down not only to customers but to all the telstra staff..\",\"\\u2018A learning experience.\\u2019 The actual work i did with technicians which was very technical sometimes. Being a contractor for 4.5 years, with no sick pay, no holiday pay, no long service leave or maternity leave to look forward to, working with gossips and fashion victims with few skills who kept their jobs when I was fired with 1 week notice and no redundancy payout.  Working with full time Telstra employees who were paid double what the contractors were and received full benefits.  Having to work Saturdays.  No one understanding that as a single mother with young kids it was not financially logical for me to work full time, I would work 10 extra hours a week for NO extra pay.  Freezing every winter because they couldn't seem to fix the heating.  No parking at work, spending a fortune on parking each month.  Having to account for every single second of your time, no flexibility, and having to carry ridiculous guilt that parents shouldn't have to carry, always wondering if you are a good employee and a good parent.  It was like being back at high school sometimes.  Thankfully I have moved on to a much better position where I feel appreciated.\",\"\\u2018Interesting and pretty laid back.\\u2019 Plenty of work.

The discounts are great. They know how to do a Christmas work party. Constant micromanagement. The fact that they have to cater to the lowest common denominator when rolling anything new out. The fact that they never appoint anyone into new positions, just rotate through people so they have a \\\\\\\"pool\\\\\\\" of leadership.\",\"\\u2018Overall, one of the best company's I have worked for, mainly because they have policies and processes which ensure management look after their people.\\u2019 They look after their people.\\nGreat brand and opportunities for development\\nDiversity,diversity, diversity.\\nAn equal employment opportunity employer Constant restructuring and pressure to do more with less. \\nDifficult to maintain work-life balance due to workload pressures.\\nEmails arriving 24/7.\",\"\\u2018I leave with fond memories of the organisation truly grateful for the leadership and learning opportunities afforded to me.\\u2019 Training, coaching and mentoring\\r\\nOpportunity to advance career and gain exposure to different roles\\r\\nClear corporate vision \\r\\nFrom a leadership perspective I worked with some very talented people all of whom were striving for a common goal (building customer advocacy) Delivering consistency from a service delivery perspective\\r\\nProcesses and systems were, at times, clunky (high level of waste elements)  i.e. duplication, completing steps that did not add value to the customer experience\",\"\\u2018It's still a great place is work, I've met a great bunch of people during my tenure. \\u2019 High daily rate, modern office, my management is open to work from home arrangement and provides the tools to support the arrangement.  The company is currently in a re-structure mode of operation, it's been going on for more than a year now and people are numbed with uncertainly, hence you will find that the company is in near stand still. My management is paralyzed with the ongoing change, no meaningful decisions are being made. \\n\",\"\\u2018So much potential but a few people tend to ruin it for everyone.\\u2019 Good salary package, benefits, work/life balance. It's a comfortable place to work for with a large scope of benefits. It offers lots of opportunities like part-time work, annual / purchase leave etc. It's not a meritocracy, lots of politics and management it's more about who you get on well with and how you're perceived than about how good you are or perform in your job.

IPhone releases were the biggest challenge for me. I didn't like telling customers that they had to write their details on a waiting list that was 3-5 weeks behind in demand. The stores were crowded and I couldn't give the customers the service that they asked for, and deserved.\\r\\nIt didn't help when they were upset and threatened to purchase the phones from elsewhere, or to change their telco.\",\"\\u2018Telstra is Good Bad and Ugly all at the same time.\\u2019 HR benefits, flexible working, fixed pay improvements annually can get salaries to a position significantly more than average over time, good severance pay (in the good section as Telstra rotate staff regularly). Great graduate programme, and young people career start opportunities. Good technology R&D and innovation exposure available. A big company - setup like many smaller operations so the experience can be anywhere from absolutely brilliant to absolutely terrible.\\nWastes so much money it is embarrassing. Many of the management lack leadership abilities. The atmosphere is often described as \\\\\\\"Toxic\\\\\\\". A lack of respect for people. Lots of customer complaints. Telstra bags its suppliers.

Not sure if this is by design.\",\"\\u2018The job taught me many skills in life, the most important one's being, people skills and respect\\u2019 For me it was the ability to teach others how to do the work and bonding with other people.

Enterprise wide agile will be rolling out but that doesn\\u2019t fix the focus on numbers and dropping the ball on enabling meaningful customer experiences. Still need to fix the basics. I wouldn\\u2019t expect the musical chairs at a senior level to minimise as the confussion and pour strategy continues. The con to this is there is now little to no career progression available.

Telstra is a huge company that is quite diverse across telecommunications and IT. Some part of Telstra actually want to do the right thing by the customer but a number of the current systems and processes they have make it difficult in many situations of delivering the right outcome. Telstra Defence program is appalling. They have deliberately tried to maximise profit at the expense of the customer.\",\"\\u2018It is a big ship so it is slow to move but when it does it changes the whole landscape.\\u2019 Amazing work/life balance with a massive push towards working from home for parents (I am not one but I do appreciate this benefit for parents as kids require them to be home) A lot of change in Media and it never felt there was continuity with management goals.\",\"\\u2018I was happy to work with Telstra through all its name changes but it was a different time and company.\\u2019 I worked for Telstra for over 40 years. I worked on many types of communication equipment and the diversity of technology and people was a very enrichening experience. The rapid change in technology and pressure to sell new products constantly makes Telstra a very stressful place to work and is most suitable to the young and dynamic.

Flexibility with work/life balance enable me to work part time after I had my 2 children. Telstra often goes through organisational restructures, which generally leads to management changes, department closures or reducing staff numbers. This causes undue unrest with staff.\",\"\\u2018Challenging, interesting, frustrating and enjoyable all at the same time.\\u2019 I had the opportunity to really step up, be challenged, and take action. I had loads of opporutnities to develop my skills, and to fill the gaps that came about in the project. Great team to work for, locatioin was awesome, as was the ability to be able to work from home when needed. Immediate project manager severely lacked management/leadership skills, and refused to have the difficult conversations. As a result, the team were placed in an undesireable predicament, and the editorial team placed under a massive amount of pressure that almost saw the project fail. :(\",\"\\u2018Lots of great people that eventually lose their motivation due to the stretching of the rubber band till it breaks.

The people above your immediate managers normally have absolutely no clue what you actually do day by day but they are the ones who make sweeping changes about how you do the work. Quite frequently you will have to find ways to tell customers it is Telstra at fault without being supposed to tell them it was Telstra fault.\",\"\\u2018Started off well but breadth of changes made every day life difficult.

I was unfortunately faced with the challenge of, after having 2 weeks classroom training, to not having a desk effectively I was only one of the 6 of us in training that could not properly start their role. After obtaining a desk 2 weeks later, I had a manager come up to me saying I was about 2 weeks behind everyone else and they effectively hoped I would be up to their speed. This is 2 weeks after everyone else of the training group had a full time buddy sitting with them and helping them with every enquiry they had and I had started that day and did not have a buddy but essentially was sitted with (despite behing 100% lovely) a very busy, occupied and unavailable person.

You work when they tell you to work & for how many hours they tell you or find somewhere else. They used to be more reasonable & allow things like job sharing + roster preferences.\",\"\\u2018A great job for high school leavers.\\u2019 They pay you well and offer great bonuses. You get given a uniform and they have lots of training. They do not cater for anyone with other commitments. They do not allow for study or sporting commitments. You are expected to work the full amount of hours.\",\"\\u2018Team  leading and handling at the best\\u2019 Customer friendly and close internal and personnel relationship with the staff and management. Good thing is that, being a team leader I learned so much about the company as well as about my skills and ability. Being a marketing personnel, its important to face challenges everyday. After all that is the ability of marketing staff who bring business for the company. 450 SIM to be sold every month as a target for team leader which my team used to achieve every month.\",\"\\u2018Exciting yet always challenging but definitely unforgettable!!!\\u2019 The team environment, learning about new technology, being part of a family.

Company really need to evaluate their middle management as I know a lot of good staff have left due to management\\u2019 Great incentives given by business partners of Vodafone Middle management makes it hard to preform well. With ridiculous expectations not given by the company itself by store and territory managers. Indecent remarks became quite regular in a lot of stores I worked in by management.\",\"\\u2018Good opportunities, large KPI pressure\\u2019 Opportunities for growth were high.

I was fortunate to have had some really brilliant managers and colleagues. It can be hard work but the perks and team fun are worth it. Bupa really cared for it\\u2019s people as well as it\\u2019s customers as well - skin checks, massages, Christmas hampers, heavily discounted insurance - all amazing. There is a very long tenure here so opportunities for career progression were limited in the city I was based in.\",\"\\u2018I would thoroughly recommend the company as a whole to work for. Amazing opportunities and training was outstanding.\\u2019 The work/  life balance. Always felt like an individual and not just a number. Really enjoyed my time with the company. Great incentives and KPI targets were very fair. A somewhat negative manager at the end of my time with the company was my biggest challenge. Did not feel supported by the individual store management team at the time of leaving the company.\",\"\\u2018A company that cares and rewards hard work\\u2019 Bupa genuinely cares for its customers and its employees. You get subsidised health insurance, flexible working hours and a sense that you're doing something of value in the community. Bupa's got offices throughout the country, but its Head Office is Melbourne, meaning that any career progression tends to require a move to Melbourne. If you're content with an entry level - lower management role, Brisbane is fine. But otherwise, if you aspire for more, your career will reach its ceiling here in Brisbane pretty quickly.\",\"\\u2018Not really impressed about respect for people\\u2019 I worked as a casual for a couple of months did a great job applied for a couple of full time roles they would not even give me an interview for the roles after I did my job they couldnt wait for me to finish my contract they dont want to help people and they dont care about people even though they are a health company Dealing with people that should not be doing the job they are doing\",\"\\u2018Hard work is well recognised and rewarded.\\u2019 Great environment. Real team mindset. Wonderful formal (& in-formal) opportunities for development. Working with people who just want to clock in and clock out, but that is a challenge at any job.\",\"\\u2018Frustrating.\\u2019 Some of the other staff were nice. Management was poor. I didn't receive proper training for the role. No one took responsibility for my training, everyone just said it was someone else's job to do it. Then I got told off for not doing my job correctly/efficiently.\",\"\\u2018Great work environment too bad only hiring temps\\u2019 Being a claim processor, we have reasonable work load and great work environment with professional barista making coffee for us during work hours. Unfortunately Bupa doesn't offer full time positions to claim processors so the whole floor is temps.\",\"\\u2018Work hard because you love working to Bupa\\u2019 They are flexible with work arrangements and offer a great career path to nurses but professionals from other backgrounds have very limited opportunities. The work load is insane and as most of the big companies the communication is poor and the decision/resolutions process is very slow.\",\"\\u2018A valuable learning experience in a supportive environment.\\u2019 Supportive, reward and recognition, opportunity to develop, pay increases and bonuses. Call centre work can be draining, but with the right motivation it's also rewarding.\",\"\\u2018Great fun but low pay, no bonus yet high performance\\u2019 Work friends and travel, good equipment direct manager was sensational love working with a great team of nurses.

at Coles always at Coles\\u2019 There are different departments to work in and many shifts to work according to your availability . Coles Supermarkets are open from 6:00 am to 12:00 P.m. but overnight shifts are also there. Just bring your willingness  and energy  to work. Your skills May not be utilised completely\",\"\\u2018Well looked after, a great company to work for.\\u2019 Working in family-based environment, we're like a family, everyone gets along, receiving  boxes of chocolate at christmas from the company. Coles looks after you. Understanding staff workplace health and mental health. Flexible hours, awards are given out for work, Coles recognising you, in regards into how long you have worked there for example; 5 or 10 years, you'll receive a luncheon, or if a team member is leaving you will receive a going away lunch as well. Coles is a very good company to work for. As well as having Wesfarmers as our parent company, there are offers to benefit Coles team members as well from Wesfarmers. Ive enjoyed working with the people who i work with, seeing people come and go. The late nights, really drains you after working a week of night shifts. Another challenge would be Christmas eve. Very busy indeed, but that day alway goes the fastest, fastest working day of the year. \\r\\nI'd love to have more new things in the workplace, more updated facilities. For example; new sinks or taps little things like that.\",\"\\u2018A steady, challenging but worth job. Sometimes a little tiring, but rewarding at the end of the day.\\u2019 The working environment is friendly. The supervisors, managers and the workers take care of you well. There are plenty of opportunities to branch out into different departments and one department doesn't consist of just one task but rather, there are multiple jobs to do which makes every shift interesting and enjoyable. When the store gets extremely busy, working non-stop four hours without any break can be a little exhausting and quite painful with all the constant heavy-lifting. There are room for improvement within Coles in general with all the team members working as a team and in terms of the amount of work each worker is assigned. I feel as though the hours are not flexible and in terms of being able to get set a permanent time roster, it is not possible due to the large number of workers?\",\"\\u2018Tightening of budgets,cutting of hours & poor store management are the reasons I left employment earlier than planned.  I did not feel valued after 22 years of service & was disappointed in the way team theft was handled at storel level\\u2019 A good manager can make all the difference to team morale. Great teamwork that is recognised helps you feel valued Overall Coles streamlining tasks means that staff are stretched too thinly, and work satisfaction & customer service suffers.\",\"\\u2018Challenging, fun but sometimes struggling and days when you want to give up\\u2019 Overall good company to work for\\r\\nSome good and supporrtive managers A lot of people who are not management think they are\\r\\nA lot of gossiping goes on\\r\\nReduced hours due to coles services\\r\\nHaving to wait 8 years to go part time whilst others who worked there less time were granted part time hours before me\",\"\\u2018Really loved the time I worked with them.\\u2019 I had a great time with Coles Services. The management and staff were very helpful and easy going. The hours were good. Maintenance on the equipment was done within 24 hour time frame. Enjoyed my stay there. The equipment was a challenge when breakdowns happened. It was tough but you just work your way through the problems.  Time frame for some tasks were a challenge however,  all was completed within the time frame given.\",\"\\u2018Loyal and a good experience\\u2019 Working in flexible hours Working with customers\",\"\\u2018Frustrating\\u2019 I love the job.

Generally they look after their employees well. With regular restructuring, outsourcing and cost cutting, employee can have the sense of insecurity\",\"\\u2018Not enough shifts a week\\u2019 Working with a variety of people, staff discount after 3 months, Time allocation, different tasks assigned, pushing trolleys,\",\"\\u2018I really love working at Coles\\u2019 I go to work and it\\u2019s not stressful and have a great time.

Unethical management of suppliers,\",\"\\u2018Great pay but is it worth it?\\u2019 Coles helps you advance your career and pays extremely well for its salaried employees. If you work hard you get opportunity For salaried people, 12 hour days are Common and often days are longer than that again. You must be happy being at work early in the morning and late at night, overnight are common too. Little regard is given to academic qualifications. You need to be able to self promote and talk a good game, this is often more important than actual skills.\",\"\\u2018Overall this is a pysical but rewarding Job.\\u2019 As a driver, Im out on my own, and each customer I deliver to  WANTS me to be there.  This makes for a good experience. The weather.  It can be physically demanding so basic fitness is needed.
